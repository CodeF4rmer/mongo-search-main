As previously stated, BHP regularly reviews its portfolio of assets in order to seek opportunities to maximise long-term shareholder value.\n\nBHP confirms that we have initiated a strategic review of our Petroleum business to re-assess its position and long-term strategic fit in the BHP portfolio.

On the back of these results, the Board has announced a record final dividend of US$2.00 per share, bringing BHP’s returns to shareholder to more than US$15 billion for the full year.\n\nOur strategy is to deliver long-term value and returns through the cycle. We aim to do this through owning a portfolio of world class assets with exposure to highly attractive commodities which benefit from the mega-trends playing out in the world around us, by operating them exceptionally well, by maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation and through being industry leaders in sustainability and the creation of social value.\n\nAs the world continues to evolve, BHP is positioning itself to benefit from the mega-trends and through sustainability leadership.\n\nTo this end, today we have announced:\n\n Investment in the Jansen Stage 1 potash project which is aligned with our strategy of growing our exposure to future facing commodities in world class assets;\n\n Agreement to pursue a merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside to create a global top 10 independent energy company with a large-scale portfolio of producing, development and exploration assets; and\n\n Intention to unify our corporate structure under BHP’s existing Australian parent company to realise simplification and enhanced strategic flexibility benefits.\n\n  BHP Chair, Ken MacKenzie:\n\n“BHP’s performance over the past year illustrates the strength of our portfolio, balance sheet, people and performance culture. Including the record dividend announced today of US$2.00 per share, we have returned over US$15 billion to shareholders over the past year.\n\nBHP is in a strong position to manage its future in a time of rapid change. We have a clear strategy and are executing against it. Jansen Stage 1 will give BHP exposure to a commodity with a strong demand outlook and decades of potential growth. The agreement to pursue a merger of BHP’s Petroleum business with Woodside will maximise the value of our oil and gas assets through increased operating scale and synergies, with a more diversified product portfolio to support the energy transition. Now is the right time to unify BHP’s corporate structure. BHP will be simpler and more efficient, with greater flexibility to shape our portfolio for the future. Our plans announced today will better enable BHP to pursue opportunities in new and existing markets and create value and returns over generations.”\n\nBHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry:\n\n“The BHP team has achieved a great set of operational and financial results in the year past. This is thanks to both the outstanding effort of 80,000 people across the company, as well as to the support of BHP’s thousands of suppliers and customers, and our host communities and governments. Most importantly, our improved results were achieved safely, with 2021 being our second consecutive full financial year with zero fatalities in BHP operations. We achieved several\n\n production records and our four major capital projects were executed on time and on budget. We continue to invest in people and technology, setting BHP up for ongoing improvement in performance.\n\nWe continue to actively position our portfolio as well for future returns and growth. We have progressed exploration and development in copper and nickel, commodities which are favourably leveraged to the mega-trends of electrification and decarbonisation. In sanctioning the Jansen Stage 1 project in Canada, we gain access not only to the healthy returns of this project on a stand-alone basis, but to a new front for growth in a future facing commodity in the world’s best potash basin and an attractive investment jurisdiction. The merger of our petroleum business with Woodside will create a top 10 global independent energy company, unlocking value for BHP shareholders, including through synergies, and a stronger, more resilient combined business that will be better positioned to continue to grow value as it navigates the energy transition.”\n\n 1\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\nNote: All guidance is subject to further potential impacts from COVID-19 during the 2022 financial year.\n\nKeeping our people and communities safe\n\n There were no fatalities at our operated assets over the last two and a half years. High Potential Injury frequency(i) declined by 17% and Total Recordable Injury Frequency(i) decreased by 11% during the year.\n\n Our ongoing focus on safety, health and wellbeing has enabled us to deliver strong safety and operational performance.\n\nOperational excellence: Strong operational performance and free cash flow generation, with a margin of 64%\n\n Strong underlying operational performance, with record volumes achieved at Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO), Goonyella and Olympic Dam, and Escondida maintained average concentrator throughput at record levels.\n\n Profit from operations of US$25.9 billion, up 80%, and Underlying EBITDA(ii) of US$37.4 billion at a record(iii) margin(ii) of 64%.\n\n Attributable profit of US$11.3 billion (includes an exceptional loss of US$5.8 billion predominantly related to the impairments of our potash and energy coal assets, and the current year impact of the Samarco dam failure). Underlying attributable profit(ii) of US$17.1 billion, up 88% from the prior year.\n\n Net operating cash flow of US$27.2 billion, above US$15 billion for the fifth consecutive year, and record(iii) free cash flow(ii) of US$19.4 billion, reflects higher iron ore and copper prices, and a strong operational performance.\n\nDisciplined capital allocation: Four major projects delivered and early stage options added\n\n Capital and exploration expenditure(ii) within guidance at US$7.1 billion. Minerals capital and exploration expenditure is expected to be approximately US$6.7 billion for the 2022 financial year (and a further US$2.3 billion for Petroleum).\n\n Successfully achieved first production at four major development projects, all of which were delivered on or ahead of schedule and on budget. We acquired an additional 28% working interest in Shenzi in November 2020. The Shenzi North development, a two-well subsea tie-in to the Shenzi platform, was approved in August 2021.\n\n In exploration, we have continued to add to our early stage options in future facing commodities throughout the year, with the recently announced recommended all-cash takeover offer of Noront Resources in Canada, the signing of an agreement for a nickel exploration alliance in Canada and of a farm-in agreement for the Elliott copper project in Australia. At Oak Dam in South Australia, next stage resource definition drilling commenced in May 2021.\n\n Net debt at US$4.1 billion, compared to US$12.0 billion at 30 June 2020. In light of our announcement to pursue a merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside, we will be reviewing our net debt target and will provide an update with our interim results for the 2022 financial year in February 2022.\n\nValue and returns: Consistently high cash returns, US$15.2 billion of total announced returns to shareholders\n\n The Board has determined to pay a final dividend of US$2.00 per share or US$10.1 billion, which includes an additional amount of US$0.91 per share (equivalent to US$4.6 billion) above the 50% minimum payout policy. Total dividends announced of US$3.01 per share, equivalent to an 89% payout ratio.\n\n      Underlying return on capital employed(ii) strengthened to 32.5%.

The merger is subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of full form transaction documents, and satisfaction of conditions precedent including shareholder, regulatory and other approvals.\n\n On completion, it is expected Woodside would be owned approximately 52% and 48% by existing Woodside and BHP shareholders respectively, and will remain listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) with listings on additional exchanges being considered.\n\n The proposed merger would create a global top 10 independent energy company by production and would be the largest energy company on the ASX.\n\n It will give our shareholders greater choice about how to weight their exposure to the different investment propositions of BHP and Petroleum via Woodside.\n\n It is expected to deliver substantial benefits for our shareholders, including estimated synergies of more than US$400 million per annum.\n\n With the combination of two high quality asset portfolios, the combined business will have a high margin oil portfolio, long life LNG assets and the financial resilience to help supply the energy needed for global growth and development over the energy transition.\n\nIntention to unify our corporate structure under BHP’s existing Australian parent company to drive simplicity and flexibility\n\n BHP intends to unify its Dual Listed Company (DLC) structure, subject to final Board and other approvals. Unification would result in a corporate structure that is simpler and more efficient, reduce duplication and streamline our governance and internal processes.\n\n As we position the company for the future operating environment, a unified structure will improve flexibility for portfolio reshaping to maximise value for shareholders over the long-term, including facilitating a simpler separation of Petroleum.\n\n Following recent changes to our portfolio there has been a significant reduction in earnings contribution from Plc assets, as well as a material reduction in the expected costs of unification of approximately US$1.2 billion, with one- off costs now expected to be US$400 to US$500 million.\n\n Plc shareholders' shares will be exchanged for Limited shares on a one-for-one basis. BHP's Board, management, dividend policy, ability to distribute fully franked dividends and fundamentals will remain the same.\n\n It is expected that a unified BHP would have its primary listing on the ASX, a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), and a sponsored Level II ADR program on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\n\n If approved, unification is expected to occur in the first half of the 2022 calendar year, with the proposed Petroleum merger with Woodside to follow.\n\nAdditional information included on pages 17 to 21.\n\n 3\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nDelivering strong performance\n\nBHP delivered a strong set of results for the 2021 financial year. We were safe, more reliable and more productive, and we increased our efforts to pursue further improvements in our safety and wellbeing performance. We have now had over two and a half years without a fatality at our operated assets and we have seen a sustained improvement in our key safety performance indicators. High Potential Injury frequency has decreased by 17 per cent during the year and a reduction of 35 per cent since the 2019 financial year. Total Recordable Injury Frequency has continued to decline, down 11 per cent during the year to 3.7(vi), and a reduction of 21 per cent over the last two years. Our two largest assets, Western Australia Iron Ore and our Escondida copper mine have continued to deliver production and throughput respectively at record levels, as did Olympic Dam which achieved the highest annual copper production since BHP acquired the asset in 2005 and the highest gold production ever for the operation. When combined with our strong reliability and disciplined cost control, this has helped us to benefit from record high iron ore and copper prices.\n\nWe generated record free cash flow, return on capital employed strengthened to 32.5 per cent and our balance sheet is strong, with net debt finishing the year at US$4.1 billion. On the back of these results, the Board has announced a record final dividend of US$2.00 per share, bringing BHP’s returns to shareholder to more than US$15 billion for the full year, and more than US$38 billion over the past three years.\n\nWe are continuing to unlock even greater performance from our equipment and infrastructure through enabling our people and investing in capability. We continue to build a more inclusive and diverse workforce to further enhance performance excellence. This includes our aspirational goal of a gender balanced workforce by 2025. We had 48 per cent female external hires during the year, which has resulted in a material increase of female representation(i) in the workforce, up three percentage points to 29.8 per cent. The Executive Leadership Team established last year has 50 per cent female representation.\n\nWe are reliably delivering our major growth and sustaining capital projects in copper, iron ore and petroleum, with all major projects during the year executed on time and on budget despite COVID-19 challenges. The Spence Growth Option (SGO) copper project and the South Flank iron ore sustaining project, which will contribute to improved grade and increased lump in our iron ore product suite, both began production and are ramping up. In Petroleum, the Atlantis Phase 3 and Ruby growth projects both started producing over the last 12 months, and we completed the counter- cyclical acquisition of an additional interest in the Shenzi asset. In nickel and copper, we have established further exploration partnerships, acquired new tenements and progressed greenfield exploration.\n\nIn addition to strengthening economic growth, in the past year we have seen growing national ambitions and some positive steps towards overcoming the challenge of climate change. This is aligned with, and has reinforced, our perspective on the unfolding mega-trends of decarbonisation, electrification, population growth and the drive for higher living standards in the developing world, which we see becoming key drivers of commodity demand. We expect our diversified portfolio to be resilient under a number of different long-term scenarios, and in fact, that many of our commodities would further benefit from an accelerated decarbonisation pathway(vii). We continue to pursue opportunities to further strengthen our portfolio and our exposure to these long-term trends.\n\nWe have invested through the cycle in high returning growth projects, and in options for future development and value creation in copper, nickel, oil and potash through innovation, exploration, early stage investment and development. Creating and securing more options in future facing commodities remains a priority.\n\nCreating social value\n\nWe are committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders and consider social value and financial value in the decisions we make. Social value is our positive contribution to society – to our people, partners, economy, environment and local communities.\n\nSafety and sustainability\n\nThe safety, health and wellbeing of our workforce and the communities in which we operate are fundamental to our ability to contribute to social value. We have continued to demonstrate this throughout the COVID-19 pandemic with the ongoing, safe performance of our operated assets. We have provided significant support to local businesses, and regional and Indigenous communities where we operate in response to COVID-19 and have established programs to support the public health response.\n\n 4\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\nAt our operated assets, we remain vigilant and will continue with social distancing and hygiene practices, and other additional protocols as appropriate to protect our workforce and communities from COVID-19, in line with guidelines from local and national government bodies and expert health advice in the countries where we operate. Many of these measures remain in place. Our Australian operations have effectively managed the rapidly changing environment relating to interstate travel and border access, however ongoing frequent border restrictions create uncertainty in managing the business. In Chile, the operating environment is expected to continue to be challenging as COVID-19 cases in the country remain elevated, with reductions in our on-site workforce forecast to continue in the 2022 financial year.\n\nDespite the challenges, our people have continued their focus on safety. Our global safety improvement programs are progressing well and our safety leading indicators have continued a strong positive trend underpinning the current safety performance. We have now had over two and a half years without a fatality at our operated assets and we continue to focus on fostering a culture of respect and ensuring our workplace is safe at all times.\n\nOur ambition to minimise our withdrawals of high-quality fresh water(viii) and replace them with seawater or low-quality withdrawals where feasible saw a continued reduction in freshwater withdrawals(i), which were 11 per cent lower in the 2021 financial year compared to the prior year and are now 27 per cent below the 2017 baseline for our five year target.\n\nCommunities remain a critical part of our social value contribution\n\nOur community and social investment commitment (one per cent of pre-tax profit), which began 20 years ago, is aligned with our broader business priorities and contributes to the resilience of the communities and environment where we have a presence. This is one of the critical parts of creating social value.\n\nIn response to COVID-19, we have worked closely with local businesses, and regional and Indigenous communities where we operate in both the immediate response to COVID-19 and in the recovery phase. This has included financial support to local and regional health networks, the provision of essential community services including mental health, training and upskilling, enhancing technology and targeted support to remote Indigenous communities. In addition, we secured and donated medical personal protective equipment and other health and sanitation goods to communities and organisations where supply was interrupted.\n\nWe also partnered with the communities where we operate, by offering training and apprenticeships on emerging technologies, systems and practices to build future capabilities.\n\nAs part of our social value contribution, we also fund the BHP Foundation, which continues to work with partner organisations globally to address some of the world’s most critical sustainable development challenges. These efforts are designed to address challenges that are directly relevant to the global resources sector and contribute towards many of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals focussing on the governance of natural resources, environmental resilience and education equity. The BHP Foundation’s global partnership with Transparency International supports governments to identify and address corruption risks in mining licensing processes, and its global programs supporting Indigenous peoples have enabled Indigenous land management activities covering the Ten Deserts of Australia and traditional lands in the Boreal Forests of Canada and the Amazon basin of Peru. Further information can be found at: bhp.com/foundation.\n\nWith effect from 1 July 2021, BHP has reduced to seven-day payment terms for all small, local and Indigenous suppliers, getting cash into their hands sooner. This will benefit over 4,000 suppliers globally, including in Australia, Chile, North America and Canada. These include suppliers that are a part of the Local Buying Program in Australia and South America.\n\nOur approach to cultural heritage is driven by the commitments made in our Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement, our Indigenous Peoples Strategy and our Reconciliation Action Plan. During the year, we continued to work with Traditional Owner groups and other Indigenous representative organisations to further strengthen our cultural heritage management practices. We also continue to support efforts to further strengthen the laws, policies and practices that regulate the management of cultural heritage values.\n\n  5\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nDelivering on our climate change commitments\n\nWe have made strong progress on actions required to meet our commitments to reduce operational emissions.\n\nIn September 2020, we signed a renewable power purchasing agreement (PPA) to meet half of our electricity needs across our Queensland Coal operations from low emissions sources. We also executed a 15-year contract extension to our power purchase agreement at Nickel West, which provides additional ability to integrate renewable electricity generation. Our four new renewable power contracts for Escondida and Spence commence from the 2022 financial year, as part of our aim to achieve 100 per cent renewable supply at both operations by the mid-2020s. In August 2021, BHP became a founding member of Komatsu’s GHG Alliance, providing engineering, technical and mining expertise with the aim of accelerating the path to market of zero-greenhouse gas emissions haul trucks.\n\nIn line with the 2030 Scope 3 goals we set in 2020, we have taken actions to contribute to decarbonisation in our value chain. In steelmaking, we have entered into three partnerships that are targeted at the development and deployment of technologies to support a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in integrated steelmaking for an aggregate investment of up to US$65 million. We signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with:\n\n China’s HBIS Group Co., Ltd (HBIS), one of the world’s largest steelmakers and one of our major iron ore customers, to collaborate on three priority areas: hydrogen-based direct reduction technology, the recycling and reuse of steelmaking slag, and the role of iron ore lump utilisation to help reduce emissions from ironmaking and steelmaking (March 2021).\n\n JFE Steel, one of Japan’s largest steel producers, to study the properties of raw materials, with focus on specific areas such as iron ore pre-treatment, use of enhanced iron ore lump, high quality coke and DRI, required to decrease iron and steelmaking emissions (February 2021).\n\n World leading steel producer, China Baowu, to collaborate on technical solutions to utilise low carbon fuel sources such as hydrogen injection in the blast furnace, and explore other low emission options (November 2020).\n\nThe combined output of these three steelmakers equates to around 10 per cent of global steel production(ix).\n\nIn shipping, we have also taken a number of actions to help reduce emissions in our value chain:\n\n We awarded the world’s first LNG-fuelled Newcastlemax bulk carriers contract, since replicated by others, with the aim to reduce CO2-e emissions by up to 34 per cent per voyage (September 2020).\n\n We also took part in a successful marine biofuel trial which will support development of a strategy on the supply of biofuels and its use on our key shipping routes (April 2021).\n\n We announced the signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation to become one of the founding members of Singapore’s Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD). The centre will spearhead the maritime industry’s energy transition journey. BHP is the only resources company that is part of the alliance (April 2021).\n\nBuilding on our leading practice in climate risk management, disclosure and engagement, we plan to put forward a non-binding advisory Say on Climate to shareholders at our 2021 AGMs in the form of a vote with respect to our new Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP). The CTAP will cover the focus areas of the Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark and in particular, provide further information on our approach to addressing emissions in our value chain (Scope 3 emissions).\n\n 6\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n Social value: key indicators scorecard(1)\n\n       Key indicators\n\nFatalities\n\nHigh Potential Injury (HPI) frequency(i) (per million hours worked)\n\nTRIF(i)\n\n(per million hours worked)\n\nOperational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions(i)\n\n(Mt CO2-e)\n\nValue chain emissions(i)\n\nTarget FY21\n\nFY21\n\n0 0.20\n\n3.7 8.0\n\n\n\n\n\n60.9\n\n144.3\n\n1,064 29.8 7.2\n\n7.5 13.5(6)\n\nFY21\n\n0 0.20\n\n3.6 8.2\n\n\n\n\n\n52.6\n\n30.5\n\n1,112\n\n27.4 6.7\n\n6.8\n\n12.8\n\nFY20\n\n0 0.24\n\n4.2\n\n15.9\n\n-\n\n-\n\n127.0\n\n149.6\n\n1,922 26.5 6.5\n\n6.6 15.0\n\nComment\n\nNo fatalities at our operated assets for over two and a half years.\n\n17 per cent decrease from FY20.\n\n11 per cent reduction from FY20.\n\nOn track to meet our FY22 and FY30 targets, despite expected increase in FY21, due to reductions in emissions from renewable power contracts in Chile and Australia.\n\nOn track to deliver 2030 goal with three low-carbon partnerships initiated with some of the world’s leading steelmakers in FY21: China Baowu, HBIS and JFE.\n\nOn track to deliver 2030 goal with award of a LNG-fuelled bulk carrier tender and LNG supply agreement, completion of a marine biofuel trial and signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation to become a founding member of the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation in FY21.\n\nOn track to meet our five-year target with an 11 per cent reduction from FY20 and 27 per cent reduction from FY17 baseline.\n\nImpacts this year include (i) >12.8M hectares conserved, restored or improved management; (ii) 19,000 people completing training aligned with the future of work, with >1,500 people obtaining paid employment.\n\nOver US$4 billion directed to local suppliers in the past two financial years.\n\nWe have achieved a 12 percentage point increase from FY16, with 48 per cent female external hires in FY21.\n\nContinued increase throughout FY21.

In total, Renova has spent R$14 billion (approximately US$3.3 billion(x)) on remediation and compensation programs to 30 June 2021.\n\nCompensation and financial assistance of approximately R$4.7 billion (approximately US$1.1 billion) has been paid to support approximately 336,000 people affected by the Fundão dam failure up until 30 June 2021(xi). Resettlement of communities continues to progress despite ongoing challenges, including the implementation of precautionary measures to minimise the spread of COVID-19(xii).\n\nA Framework Agreement was entered into between Samarco, Vale and BHP Brasil and the relevant Brazilian authorities in March 2016 and established the Renova Foundation to develop and implement environmental and socio- economic programs to remediate and provide compensation for damage caused by the Samarco dam failure. Negotiations are ongoing with State and Federal Prosecutors and certain other Brazilian public authorities on the review of the Framework Agreement, seeking a definitive and substantive settlement of claims relating to the dam failure. It is not possible to provide a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential settlement outcomes and there is a risk that a negotiated outcome may be materially higher than amounts currently reflected in the Samarco dam failure provision. Until any revisions to the Programs are agreed, Fundação Renova will continue to implement the Programs in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement and the Governance Agreement. The suspended R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion(x)) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim is under discussion as part of these negotiations.\n\nBHP has reported a total income statement charge of US$1.2 billion (after tax) in relation to the Samarco dam failure for the 2021 financial year. This charge is recognised as an exceptional item. Additional commentary is included on page 53.\n\n 8\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nFinancial performance\n\nNote: All guidance is subject to further potential impacts from COVID-19 during the 2022 financial year\n\nEarnings and margins\n\n Attributable profit of US$11.3 billion includes an exceptional loss of US$5.8 billion (2020: US$8.0 billion, which includes a US$1.1 billion exceptional loss).\n\n The exceptional loss of US$5.8 billion (after tax) relates to an impairment charge in relation to potash of US$2.1 billion, an impairment charge in relation our energy coal assets of US$2.2 billion (New South Wales Energy Coal of US$1.7 billion, and Cerrejón of US$0.5 billion), COVID-19 related costs of US$0.4 billion and the current year impact of the Samarco dam failure of US$1.2 billion. The impairment charge against our potash assets reflects an analysis of recent market perspectives and the value that we would now expect a market participant to attribute to our investments to date. The impairment charge for New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) reflects the status of the divestment process and forecast market conditions for thermal coal, the strengthening Australian dollar and changes to the mine plan. The impairment charge for Cerrejón reflects the expected net sale proceeds. The Samarco dam failure exceptional item primarily reflects updates to the Group’s assessment of remediation and compensation costs relating to the dam failure, including increased eligibility for compensation programs reflecting the latest judicial rulings and revisions to the resettlement costs for impacted communities.\n\n Underlying attributable profit of US$17.1 billion (2020: US$9.1 billion) reflects higher commodity prices and strong operational performance.\n\n Profit from operations of US$25.9 billion (2020: US$14.4 billion) increased as a result of higher commodity prices, strong underlying operational performance, lower deferred stripping depletion at Escondida, lower fuel and energy costs, solid cost performance supported by cost reduction initiatives across our assets and other net movements. This was partially offset by the exceptional charge, unfavourable impacts of a stronger Australian dollar and Chilean peso, copper grade decline, natural field decline in Petroleum, inflation, adverse weather and planned maintenance.\n\n The total impact from COVID-19 on our operations was US$780 million (pre-tax) (2020: US$348 million). This represents the following impacts: lower volumes at our operated assets of US$234 million (2020: US$112 million) and additional direct costs of US$546 million pre-tax (exceptional item) incurred, such as increased social distancing measures including additional charter flights, accommodation, security and health and hygiene services and also temporary relocation costs due to border restrictions (US$0.2 billion), combined with higher demurrage and other standby charges due to delays caused by COVID-19 (US$0.3 billion).\n\n Underlying EBITDA of US$37.4 billion (2020: US$22.1 billion), driven by higher iron ore and copper prices, record volumes at WAIO and additional volumes from the Spence Growth Option, higher profit from equity accounted investments, lower deferred stripping depletion at Escondida, lower fuel and energy costs, disciplined cost performance and other net movements. This was partially offset by unfavourable impacts of a stronger Australian dollar and Chilean peso, copper grade decline, natural field decline in Petroleum, inflation, adverse weather and planned maintenance.\n\n Record(iii) underlying EBITDA margin of 64 per cent (2020: 53 per cent).\n\n Underlying return on capital employed strengthened to 32.5 per cent (2020: 16.9 per cent). Operational performance and costs\n\n Strong underlying performance across the portfolio, including record production at WAIO, Goonyella and Olympic Dam and concentrator throughput at record levels at Escondida, offset by the impacts of overall grade decline at our copper assets, natural field decline in Petroleum, adverse weather and planned maintenance across a number of our assets.\n\n Disciplined cost performance supported by cost reduction initiatives across our assets offset by higher inventory drawdowns at Olympic Dam and at Nickel West, and additional costs associated with the ramp-up of South Flank.\n\n9\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\n Unit costs were 14 per cent higher across our major assets predominantly reflecting unfavourable foreign exchange movements. Unit costs(ii) at Petroleum were better than guidance and reflect the optimisation of maintenance activity. We achieved unit cost guidance (based on exchange rates of AUD/USD 0.70 and USD/CLP 769) at Escondida and WAIO as a result of maintaining average concentrator throughput at record levels, lower deferred stripping costs and higher by-product credits at Escondida, and a strong performance and continued productivity improvements across the supply chain at WAIO. We also achieved revised unit cost guidance at Queensland Coal. WAIO unit costs on a C1 basis excluding third party royalties were higher than the prior year at US$12.98 per tonne (2020: US$11.82 per tonne) due to a stronger Australian dollar.\n\n Costs related to the impact from COVID-19 that are reported as an exceptional item are not included in unit costs for the 2021 financial year. At our major assets these additional costs were: US$0.91 per tonne at Queensland Coal, US$0.51 per tonne at WAIO, US$0.27 per barrel of oil equivalent at Petroleum and US$0.03 per pound at Escondida.\n\n Unit cost guidance for the 2022 financial year (based on exchange rates of AUD/USD 0.78 and USD/CLP 727) reflects: the impacts of higher guidance exchange rates and higher expected input costs across the portfolio, higher price-linked costs at Petroleum; costs related to a planned increase in material mined at Escondida due to reduced material movement in the 2021 financial year; continued productivity improvements at WAIO; and increased stripping costs largely offset by productivity uplifts at Queensland Coal. Expected costs related to the impacts from COVID-19 are included in unit cost guidance for the 2022 financial year.\n\n We will continue to drive performance and unlock value by improving productivity and reliability across the supply chain through implementing maintenance centre of excellence best practices, new technology solutions and ongoing automation.\n\n  Historical costs and guidance for our major assets are summarised below:\n\n      Medium-term FY22 guidance(1) guidance(1) <13 11 - 12 <1.10 1.20 - 1.40 <16(6) 17.50 - 18.50 -(7) 80 - 90\n\nFY21(2) at guidance realised exchange exchange\n\nFY21(2)(4)\n\nVs FY20(2) FY20(2) 9.74 11% 1.01 (1%) 12.63 17% 67.59 21%\n\n       Petroleum unit cost (US$/boe) Escondida unit cost (US$/lb) WAIO unit cost (US$/t)(5) Queensland Coal unit cost (US$/t)\n\nrates(3)\n\n10.56 0.96 13.83 75.52\n\nrates(4)\n\n10.83 1.00 14.82 81.81\n\n                      (1) FY22 and medium-term unit cost guidance includes expected costs related to the impacts from COVID-19 and are based on exchange rates of AUD/USD 0.78 and USD/CLP 727.\n\n(2) FY20 and FY21 unit costs excludes the impact from COVID-19 that was reported as an exceptional item.\n\n(3) FY21 unit costs at guidance exchange rates of AUD/USD 0.70 and USD/CLP 769.\n\n(4) Average exchange rates for FY21 of AUD/USD 0.75 and USD/CLP 746.\n\n(5) WAIO unit costs exclude freight and royalties. The breakdown of C1 unit costs, excluding third party royalties, are detailed on page 33.\n\n(6) WAIO medium-term unit cost guidance has been revised from less than US$13 per tonne predominantly reflecting a number of uncontrollable factors including updated guidance exchange rates (from AUD/USD 0.70 to AUD/USD 0.78), expected higher third party royalties and higher forecast diesel prices.\n\n(7) We remain focused on cost reduction and productivity initiatives, however given the ongoing uncertainty regarding restrictions on coal imports into China we are unable to provide medium-term unit cost guidance for Queensland Coal.\n\n10\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n  Production and guidance are summarised below:\n\nMedium-term FY22 vs\n\nFY21 vs FY21 FY20 FY20\n\n103 109 (6%) 1,636 1,724 (5%) 1,068 1,185 (10%)\n\n568 539 5% 254 248 2% 252 248 1% 284 281 1%\n\n2 - 100% 41 41 (1%) 73 73 0% 19 23 (17%) 14 16 (11%)\n\n5 7 (30%) 89 80 11%\n\n       Production\n\nPetroleum (MMboe) Copper (kt)\n\nEscondida (kt)\n\nOther copper(3) (kt) Iron ore (Mt)\n\nWAIO (Mt)\n\nWAIO (100% basis) (Mt) Samarco(5) (Mt)\n\nMetallurgical coal (Mt)\n\nQueensland Coal (100% basis) (Mt)\n\nEnergy coal (Mt) NSWEC (Mt) Cerrejón(7) (Mt)\n\nNickel (kt)\n\nguidance guidance\n\nFY22e FY21\n\n       ~109(1) ~1,200(2)\n\n~290(4) -(6)\n\n99 – 106 1,590 – 1,760 1,000 – 1,080 590 – 680 249 – 259 246 – 255 278 – 288 3 – 4 39–44 70–78 13–15 13–15 n/a 85–95\n\n(4%) – 3% (3%) – 8% (6%) – 1% 4% – 20% (2%) – 2% (2%) – 1% (2%) – 1%\n\n55% – 106% (4%) – 8% (3%) – 8%\n\n(33%) – (22%) (9%) – 5% n/a (4%) – 7%\n\n                                                                                            (1) Petroleum medium-term production guidance has been revised from approximately 106 MMboe to reflect the approval of the Shenzi North development and the potential sanction of the Scarborough gas development later in the 2021 calendar year.\n\n(2) Represents annual average copper production over the medium term.\n\n(3) Other copper comprises Pampa Norte, Olympic Dam and Antamina.\n\n(4) WAIO’s current licenced export capacity is 290 Mtpa.\n\n(5) Samarco restarted operation of one concentrator in December 2020, and had safely produced 1.9Mt (BHP share) by the end of the 2021 financial year.\n\n(6) We remain focused on cost reduction and productivity initiatives, however given the ongoing uncertainty regarding restrictions on coal imports into China we are unable to provide medium-term volume guidance for Queensland Coal.\n\n(7) We will no longer provide production guidance for Cerrejón reflecting the announced divestment of our interest in June 2021 and volumes will be reported separately from 1 July 2021 until transaction completion.\n\nCash flow and balance sheet\n\n Net operating cash flows of US$27.2 billion (2020: US$15.7 billion), above US$15 billion for the fifth consecutive year, reflects strong iron ore and copper prices, and strong underlying operating performance across the portfolio. Income tax and royalty-related taxation (petroleum resource rent tax and Chilean mining tax) payments of US$8.0 billion, included within net operating cash flows, are largely based on instalment rates using prior year tax return information. While higher profits resulted in increased tax payments during the current year, approximately US$2.6 billion of tax instalments and final tax payments relating to the 2021 financial year are expected to be made in the 2022 financial year.\n\n Free cash flow of US$19.4 billion, after capital and exploration expenditure of US$7.1 billion.\n\n Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt at US$4.1 billion at 30 June 2021 (31 December 2020: US$11.8 billion; 30 June 2020: US$12.0 billion). The decrease of US$7.9 billion in net debt in the year (or US$7.7 billion from December 2020) reflects record(iii) free cash flow generation by the operations which more than offset the record ordinary dividends paid to shareholders during the year of US$7.9 billion and US$1.1 billion of lease additions (including SGO).\n\n   Year ended 30 June\n\nNet debt at the beginning of the period IFRS 16 transition\n\nLease additions\n\nFree cash flow\n\nDividends paid\n\nDividends paid to NCI\n\nOther movements\n\nNet debt at the end of the period\n\n2021 US$M 12,044 − 1,079 (19,389) 7,901 2,127 359 4,121\n\n2020 US$M 9,446 1,778 363 (8,090) 6,876 1,043 628 12,044\n\n         We remain committed to a strong balance sheet through the commodity price cycle. In light of our announcement to pursue a merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside, we will be reviewing our net debt target and will provide an update with our interim results for the 2022 financial year in February 2022.\n\n Gearing ratio(ii) of 6.9 per cent (31 December 2020: 18.1 per cent; 30 June 2020: 18.8 per cent). 11\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nDividends\n\n The Board has determined to pay a final dividend of US$2.00 per share or US$10.1 billion. This is equivalent to a 92 per cent payout ratio (2020: 72 per cent).\n\n In total, record dividends of US$15.2 billion (US$3.01 per share) have been determined for the 2021 financial year, including an additional amount of US$6.7 billion above the minimum payout policy.\n\nCapital and exploration\n\n Capital and exploration expenditure of US$7.1 billion in the 2021 financial year was in line with guidance. This included maintenance expenditure(xiii) of US$2.3 billion and exploration of US$514 million.\n\n Capital and exploration expenditure of approximately US$6.7 billion for minerals and US$2.3 billion for petroleum is expected for the 2022 financial year. In total, this is US$0.5 billion higher than previous guidance predominantly due to unfavourable impacts of a stronger Australian dollar. Guidance is subject to exchange rate movements.\n\n This guidance includes a US$800 million exploration program in the 2022 financial year, with approximately US$260 million for our minerals exploration program (additional details on page 37) and approximately US$540 million for petroleum exploration and appraisal program (additional details on page 29).\n\n  Historical capital and exploration expenditure and guidance are summarised below:\n\nFY22e US$M Maintenance(1)(2)(3) 3,200\n\nDevelopment\n\nMinerals 3,400\n\nFY21 FY20 US$M US$M 2,336 1,853\n\n3,353 4,243 917 804 6,606 6,900 514 740 7,120 7,640\n\n        Conventional Petroleum(2)\n\nCapital expenditure (purchases of property, plant and equipment)\n\nAdd: exploration expenditure\n\nCapital and exploration expenditure – total operations\n\n1,600\n\n8,200\n\n800\n\n~9,000\n\n              (1) Includes capitalised deferred stripping of US$810 million for FY21 (FY20: US$698 million) and approximately US$800 million for FY22.\n\n(2) Petroleum capital expenditure for FY22 includes US$1.6 billion of development and US$0.1 billion of maintenance.\n\n(3) The increase in maintenance costs of approximately US$0.9 billion in FY22 primarily relates to unfavourable foreign exchange rate impacts, mine and mobile equipment replacements at Escondida and Spence, tailings and waste management at Spence and water infrastructure at WAIO.\n\n At Olympic Dam, the planned major smelter maintenance campaign and subsequent ramp up is now planned between September 2021 and March 2022 (previously between August 2021 and February 2022). This is due to the ongoing COVID-19 state border restrictions limiting personnel coming to site.\n\n Average annual sustaining capital expenditure guidance over the medium term, excluding costs associated with our automation programs, has been revised predominantly due to updated guidance exchange rates (from AUD/USD 0.70 to AUD/USD 0.78) and forecast to be approximately:\n\n- US$4.50 per tonne for WAIO (from US$4 per tonne); and\n\n- US$10 per tonne for Queensland Coal (from US$9 per tonne).\n\nProjects\n\n In August 2021, the BHP Board approved two major projects:\n\n- An investment of US$5.7 billion (C$7.5 billion) for the Jansen Stage 1 potash project in the province of\n\nSaskatchewan, Canada (additional details on pages 17 to 18); and\n\n- An investment of US$544 million for the Shenzi North development in the US Gulf of Mexico, following the successful acquisition of an additional 28 per cent working interest in Shenzi in November 2020 (additional details on page 29). The capital expenditure approved represents a 100 per cent share interest. BHP is operator and holds a 72 per cent share in Shenzi North. Repsol holds the remaining 28 per cent working interest and is expected to make a Final Investment Decision later this calendar year.\n\n At the end of the 2021 financial year, BHP had two major projects under development, which were Mad Dog Phase 2 in petroleum and Jansen mine shafts in potash. Both of these projects are tracking to plan.\n\n12\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n The Mad Dog Phase 2 project achieved a major milestone in April 2021 as the semi-submersible floating production platform, Argos, arrived in the US from South Korea. First production from Mad Dog Phase 2 is expected in the middle of the 2022 calendar year.\n\n Engineering work continues to progress at Scarborough, with production licences awarded for WA-1-R (Scarborough) and WA-62-R (North Scarborough) in November 2020. Separate to the merger commitment, BHP and Woodside (the operator) have committed to a plan towards Scarborough Final Investment Decision (FID) by the end of the 2021 calendar year. As part of this plan, BHP and Woodside have agreed an option for BHP to divest its 26.5 per cent interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture (JV) to Woodside and our 50 per cent interest in the Thebe and Jupiter JVs to Woodside if the Scarborough Joint Venture takes a FID by 15 December 2021 (additional details on page 19).\n\n  Major projects are summarised below:\n\nCommodity Project and ownership Project scope / capacity(1) US$M\n\n      Capital expenditure(1)\n\nDate of initial production\n\nTarget\n\nCY20\n\nFY21\n\nMid-CY21\n\nCY21\n\nMid-CY22\n\n      Budget\n\nProgress / comments\n\nFirst production achieved in July 2020, ahead of schedule and on budget.\n\nFirst copper production achieved in December 2020, on schedule and on budget.\n\nFirst production achieved in May 2021, on schedule and on budget.\n\nFirst production achieved in May 2021, ahead of schedule and on budget.\n\nOn schedule and budget.

We have provided training to new employees and a mastery program to address the needs of a high-calibre permanent workforce operating in modern mining. Operations Services have successfully accelerated safety and productivity improvements across our operations, including a two per cent increase in availability of haul trucks serviced by Operations Services.\n\nIn October 2020, BHP announced a further commitment to the training and funding of 2,500 Australian apprenticeships and training positions over the next five years through our FutureFit Academy. As part of this announcement, BHP also committed to supporting a further 1,000 skills development opportunities across a range of sectors in regional areas. In the last 12 months, the BHP FutureFit academy has welcomed over 400 apprentices and maintenance associates across two locations at Mackay in Queensland and Perth in Western Australia. The first intake of maintenance associates from the FutureFit Academy have been progressively deployed to an Operations Services maintenance team at WAIO and Queensland Coal during the second half of the 2021 financial year.\n\nCapital Allocation Framework\n\nAdherence to our Capital Allocation Framework aims to balance value creation, cash returns to shareholders and balance sheet strength in a transparent and consistent manner.\n\n         Net operating cash flow – total operations Our priorities for capital\n\nMaintenance capital\n\nStrong balance sheet\n\nMinimum 50% payout ratio dividend Excess cash(1)\n\nBalance sheet\n\nAdditional dividends Buy-backs\n\nOrganic development Acquisitions/(Divestments)\n\nFY21 FY20 US$B US$B\n\n27.2 15.7\n\n2.3 1.9\n\n \n\n5.0 5.0\n\n17.6 7.7\n\n9.4 0.1 2.9 1.9 - - 4.8 5.7\n\n0.5 -\n\n              (1) Includes total net cash outflow of US$2.3 billion (FY20: US$1.1 billion) which comprises dividends paid to non-controlling interests of US$2.1 billion (FY20: US$1.0 billion); net investment and funding of equity accounted investments of US$0.6 billion (FY20: US$0.6 billion) and an adjustment for exploration expenses of US$(0.4) billion (FY20: US$(0.5) billion) which is classified as organic development in accordance with the Capital Allocation Framework.\n\n14\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nOutlook\n\nEconomic outlook\n\nWe remain positive in our outlook for long-term global economic growth and commodity demand. Population growth, the infrastructure of decarbonisation and rising living standards are all expected to drive demand for energy, metals and fertilisers for decades to come.\n\nThe outlook for the short term remains uncertain. While momentum towards recovery remains intact across many key regions, vigilance with respect to COVID-19 risks is still a constant for all.\n\nInflation trends and exchange rates have been volatile. In our business specifically, many commodity-linked uncontrollable costs have moved higher. For some of our assets, constraints on the free movement of parts of our workforce are creating localised shortages and associated cost increases. While this situation persists, operational risks will be elevated.\n\nCommodities outlook\n\nGlobal crude steel production was unbalanced in the 2020 calendar year, with strong growth in China offset by a steep fall in the rest of the world (ROW). In the 2021 calendar year to date, this has corrected to some degree, with utilisation rates in the ROW back close to normal, on average, even as China continues to produce at very high run-rates. Notwithstanding regulatory uncertainty with respect to periodic output controls, and COVID-19 risks, Chinese steel production is expected to increase by around 5 per cent in the 2021 calendar year. Steel prices and margins have achieved record levels in some key ROW regions as the supply recovery has lagged the rapid improvement in downstream demand. We anticipate a continuation of strong end-use demand conditions in China and ongoing recovery in the rest of world over the course of the 2022 financial year.\n\nEfforts to decarbonise steel making are expected to proceed at different rates in different regions, based on availability of lower carbon raw feedstock (including but not exclusively scrap), the age of existing facilities, variable levels of policy support, net trade positions and differential demands for affordable steel. We expect developing nations such as India to deploy principally optimisation and transitional technologies across their steel making fleets in the coming decades. Leading mills in China and in developed regions are already experimenting with transitional and green end-state technology, with commercialisation of hydrogen-based DRI anticipated from the mid-2030s, with Europe at the forefront. Accordingly, we expect that the steel making industry will be a large purchaser of carbon offsets in coming decades even as it positions itself to pursue long run carbon neutrality.\n\nIron ore prices have been elevated since the Brumadinho tailings dam tragedy in Brazil first disrupted the market in early 2019. Conditions have been particularly tight since the second half of the 2020 calendar year, with new record highs for the 62% Fe index fines and the lump premium established. Forces contributing to price gains over the most recent half have been strong Chinese pig iron production, recovering ROW pig iron production and tight supply of branded fines products. This latter factor was partly due to production coming in towards the lower end of guidance for some of the other major iron ore producers. Other material factors in terms of the supply-demand balance included robust shipments from Port Hedland, Australia, and incremental growth from a high base from price-sensitive sources of supply. The premium for lump product has been very favourable in the most recent half, buoyed by similar factors to fines, in addition to sintering restrictions in parts of China. Medium term, China’s demand for iron ore is expected to be lower than it is today as crude steel production plateaus and the scrap-to-steel ratio rises. In the long-term, prices are expected to be determined by high cost production, on a value-in-use adjusted basis, from Australia or Brazil. Quality differentiation is expected to remain a factor in determining iron ore prices.\n\nMetallurgical coal prices faced by Australian producers in the free-on-board (FOB) market were weak for most of the 2021 financial year. Australian FOB prices were able to stage a recovery late in the financial year based on pronounced multi-regional supply constraints, recovering ROW demand and an associated acceleration of trade flow adjustments. Even so, the differential between FOB prices and the China CFR equivalent remains very wide, which represents value leakage for FOB producers. The industry faces a difficult and uncertain period ahead while natural trade flows are impaired. Long term, we believe that a wholesale shift away from blast furnace steel making, which depends on metallurgical coal, is still decades in the future. That assessment is based on our bottom-up analysis of likely regional steel decarbonisation pathways, as discussed above. Demand for seaborne Hard Coking Coals (HCC), or also referred to as high quality metallurgical coals, is expected to expand alongside the growth of the steel industry in HCC importing countries such as India.\n\n15\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nEnergy coal prices began to recover from their COVID-19 induced lows late in the 2020 calendar year, assisted by a pick-up in demand due to cold weather in North Asia, constrained supply and a bounce in Indian industrial activity. Prices FOB Newcastle rallied again moving into the North Asian summer, with supply disruptions and strengthening demand intersecting. China’s policy in respect of energy coal imports remains a key medium-term uncertainty.\n\nCopper prices have been strong, with new record highs established on the LME in the second half of the 2021 financial year. With ROW demand recovering and China’s economy continuing to perform well, the short term outlook for demand remains constructive. On the supply side, we note that actual disruption rates have been below both the long- term average and more recent experience in the calendar year to date, despite potential headwinds from COVID-19 outbreaks, political uncertainty and a number of wage negotiations at Chilean mines. Longer term, both demand and supply factors indicate that copper is an attractive avenue for future growth. Regulatory uncertainty is an emerging risk across more than one key supply region, the outcome of which could potentially influence the identity and cost of long- run marginal supply.\n\nNickel prices have been volatile within an approximate range of US$15,000/t to US$20,000/t on the LME over the second half of the 2021 financial year. Prices have been boosted, at times, by positive sentiment towards pro-growth assets, supply disruptions across multiple regions and a strong demand rebound. Demand improvements have come from both traditional uses and the battery-electric vehicle (EV) complex. Periods of price appreciation have been interspersed with abrupt but ultimately short-lived declines related to prospective developments in upstream or downstream technology. Longer term, we believe that nickel will be a substantial beneficiary of the global electrification mega-trend and that nickel sulphides will be particularly attractive. This is due to their relatively lower cost of production of battery-suitable class-1 nickel than for laterites, as well as the favourable position of integrated sulphide operations on the emission intensity curve.\n\nPotash prices have increased sharply over the last 12 months, despite ongoing excess production capacity. According to CRU, granular spot prices - CFR Brazil and US (New Orleans) FOB barge - increased to around $600 per tonne in July 2021, up more than 150 per cent and 180 per cent from a year ago respectively. Strong demand due to favourable farm economics and constrained supply from presently operating assets have combined to inspire the rally. EU sanctions on certain grades of Belarussian potash exports have amplified the existing upswing. Longer term, potash stands to benefit from the intersection of a number of global mega-trends: rising population, changing diets and the need for the sustainable intensification of agriculture. Our analysis suggests that this latter imperative becomes even more critical under certain decarbonisation pathways. We anticipate trend demand growth will progressively absorb the excess capacity currently present in the industry. That, in turn, is expected to create the need for new greenfield supply by the late 2020s or early 2030s. Canadian greenfield solution mines, which tend to be higher opex and consume more energy and water than conventional mines, are expected to set the industry’s long run trend price.\n\nCrude oil prices have recovered to above US$70 per barrel as the 2022 financial year opens. We believe further gains from here are possible given our constructive view of demand tailwinds. However, future developments in price are also expected to rely in large part on the rate at which currently curtailed supply returns, which is highly uncertain. Looking beyond this phase, our bottom-up analysis of demand, allied to systematic field decline rates, points to a long run structural supply-demand gap. Considerable investment in conventional oil is going to be required to fill that gap and maintain market balance. If that investment is not forthcoming in a timely way, the possibility of oil prices increasing aggressively cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe Japan-Korea Marker price for LNG was extraordinarily volatile across the 2021 financial year. The market balance shifted from heavily over-supplied to extremely tight going into the Northern hemisphere winter. Since that time, prices have remained elevated relative to seasonal norms, with robust demand combined with ongoing supply outages. Longer term, we believe the commodity offers a combination of systematic base decline and an attractive demand trajectory. Within global gas, LNG is expected to gain share due to indigenous supply depletion and/or competitiveness vis-a-vis pipeline imports in some regions. Against this backdrop, assets advantaged by their proximity to existing infrastructure or customers, or both, in addition to competitive emissions intensities, are expected to be attractive.\n\nFurther information on BHP’s economic and commodity outlook can be found at: bhp.com/prospects\n\n  16\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nPortfolio\n\nOverview\n\nOur strategy is to deliver long-term value and returns through the cycle. We aim to do this through owning a portfolio of world class assets with exposure to highly attractive commodities which benefit from the mega-trends playing out in the world around us, by operating them exceptionally well, by maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation and through being industry leaders in sustainability and the creation of social value.\n\nWe regularly review our portfolio to improve our asset base and optimise capital allocation decisions. We have simplified and strengthened our portfolio in recent years. We have invested through the cycle in high returning growth projects and continued to invest in options for future development and value creation in copper, nickel, oil, advantaged gas and potash through exploration, early stage investment and development, and innovation.\n\nAs the world continues to evolve, BHP is positioning itself to benefit from the mega-trends and through sustainability leadership.\n\nTo this end, today we have announced a major growth investment in the Jansen Stage 1 potash project, which is aligned with our strategy of growing our exposure to future facing commodities in world class assets, as well as our further plans to strengthen our portfolio, improve long-term value, provide choice for shareholders and to streamline our corporate structure, better enabling execution of our strategy.\n\nThese decisions will enable a greater allocation of capital in the portfolio to be directed towards future facing commodities and enhanced shareholder returns, as determined under our Capital Allocation Framework.\n\nApproval of Jansen Stage 1 potash project\n\nBHP has today approved US$5.7 billion (C$7.5 billion) in capital expenditure for the Jansen Stage 1 (Jansen S1) potash project in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Potash is a future facing commodity and Jansen S1 is aligned with BHP’s strategy of growing our exposure to future facing commodities in world class assets that are large, low cost and expandable.\n\nJansen S1 includes the design, engineering and construction of an underground potash mine and surface infrastructure including a processing facility, a product storage plant, and a continuous automated rail loading system. It also includes a Remote Operating Centre located in Saskatoon. Jansen S1 product will be shipped to export markets through Westshore, in Delta, British Columbia and the project includes funding for the required port infrastructure.\n\nJansen S1 was approved following a thorough evaluation of its risk and return metrics under our Capital Allocation Framework and it seeks to create long-term, sustainable value and returns for shareholders. Potash provides BHP with increased leverage to key global mega-trends including rising population, changing diets, decarbonisation and improving environmental stewardship. It will also give BHP diversity of product, customer and operating jurisdiction. The Jansen project also offers significant high returning growth optionality in the world’s best potash basin and an attractive investment jurisdiction.\n\nJansen S1 is expected to produce approximately 4.35 million tonnes of potash per annum(iv). First ore is targeted in the 2027 calendar year, with construction expected to take approximately six years, followed by a ramp up period of two years. The Jansen S1 development incorporates the latest proven equipment and digital technologies, with a hard- to-replicate design and built in structural advantages. Jansen S1 is designed with a focus on sustainability, including a low carbon footprint and low water intensity embedded in the design.\n\nAs the world’s largest undeveloped potash deposit, future expansions at Jansen have been de-risked through the existing shaft capacity. This enables lower capital intensity, shorter execution duration and high-return brownfield expansions, with a basin position that could support a 100-year operation.\n\nAt consensus prices(v), the go-forward investment on Jansen S1 is expected to generate an internal rate of return of 12 to 14 per cent, an expected payback period of seven years from first production and an underlying EBITDA margin of approximately 70 per cent given its expected first quartile cost position.\n\n17\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nWe have previously acknowledged the US$4.5 billion (pre-tax) of capital invested to date has resulted in a significant initial outlay and that our approach would be different if considering the project again today. The investment to date includes construction of the shafts and associated infrastructure (US$2.97 billion(xiv) scope of work), as well as engineering and procurement activities, and preparation works related to Jansen S1 underground infrastructure. The construction of two shafts and associated infrastructure at the site is 93 per cent complete and expected to be finalised in the 2022 calendar year. To date approximately 50 per cent of all engineering required for Jansen S1 has also been completed, significantly de-risking the project. If the investment to date were to be included, the full cycle project would yield a much lower internal rate of return.\n\nIn addition to the investment approval, we have also assessed the carrying value of the existing potash asset base as at 30 June 2021 and have recognised a pre-tax impairment charge of US$1.3 billion (US$2.1 billion after-tax). The impairment will reduce the carrying value of the potash asset base to approximately US$3.3 billion. The impairment charge against our potash assets reflects analysis of recent market perspectives and the value that we would now expect a market participant to attribute to our investments to date.\n\nAgreement to pursue a merger of Petroleum with Woodside\n\nBHP announced today a merger proposal to combine its Petroleum (Petroleum) business with Woodside Petroleum Ltd (Woodside) (refer joint announcement, 17 August 2021).\n\nBHP and Woodside have entered into a merger commitment deed to combine their respective oil and gas portfolios by an all-stock merger. The merger is subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of full form transaction documents which is targeted for October 2021, and satisfaction of conditions precedent including shareholder, regulatory and other approvals.\n\nThe proposed merger would create a global top 10 independent energy company by production, with a global top 10 position in the LNG industry, and would be the largest energy company listed on the ASX. It will give our shareholders greater choice about how to weight their exposure to the different investment propositions of BHP and Petroleum via Woodside.\n\nWith the combination of two high quality asset portfolios, the combined business will have a high margin oil portfolio, long life LNG assets and the financial resilience to help supply the energy needed for global growth and development over the energy transition.\n\nThe substantial benefits of the proposed merger for BHP’s shareholders is expected to include:\n\n– greater scale and diversity of geographies, products and end markets through an attractive and long-life conventional portfolio;\n\n– resilient, high margin operating cash flows to fund shareholder returns and business evolution to support the energy transition;\n\n– strong growth profile with a plan to achieve targeted Scarborough FID in the 2021 calendar year and capacity to phase the most competitive, high-return options within the portfolio;\n\n– proven management and technical capability from both companies;\n\n– shared values and focus on sustainable operations, carbon management and ESG leadership;\n\n– estimated synergies of more than US$400 million (100 per cent basis, pre-tax) per annum from optimising corporate processes and systems, leveraging combined capabilities and improving capital efficiency on future growth projects and exploration; and\n\n– greater financial resilience, relative to BHP and Woodside’s standalone petroleum businesses.\n\nUnder the proposed transaction, Woodside or a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodside, will acquire 100 per cent of the issued share capital of BHP Petroleum International Pty Ltd in exchange for shares in Woodside, which will hold the combined business. The Woodside shares will be immediately distributed to BHP shareholders. On completion, it is expected Woodside would be owned approximately 52 per cent and 48 per cent by existing Woodside and BHP shareholders respectively. Woodside will remain listed on the ASX with listings on additional exchanges being considered. It is intended that the Woodside Board will appoint a current BHP director as a Woodside director on completion.\n\n 18\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\nBoth the BHP and Woodside Boards of directors confirm their support for the proposed merger. The merger is expected to be completed in the second quarter of the 2022 calendar year with an effective date of 1 July 2021.\n\nThe merger is subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of full form transaction documents which is targeted for October 2021, and satisfaction of conditions precedent including shareholder, regulatory and other approvals. Under the merger commitment deed, each party has agreed to pursue a merger transaction and agreed to certain exclusivity arrangements and to each pay a reimbursement fee of approximately US$160 million in certain circumstances.\n\nFurther information about the proposed merger with Woodside will be provided in due course.\n\nIn a separate arrangement, BHP and Woodside have committed to a plan towards Scarborough Final Investment Decision (FID) by the end of the 2021 calendar year, prior to the proposed completion date for the merger. As part of this plan, BHP and Woodside have agreed an option for BHP to divest its 26.5 per cent interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture (JV) to Western and its 50 per cent interest in the Thebe and Jupiter JVs to Woodside if the Scarborough JV takes a FID by 15 December 2021. The option is exercisable by BHP in the second half of the 2022 calendar year and if exercised, consideration of US$1 billion is payable to BHP with adjustment from an effective date of 1 July 2021. An additional US$100 million is payable contingent upon a future FID for a Thebe Development.\n\nIntention to unify BHP’s Dual Listed Company (DLC) Structure\n\nBHP announced today that it intends to unify its DLC structure, subject to final Board and other approvals.\n\nBHP’s DLC structure has two parent companies (BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc) operating as a single economic entity and was established with the BHP and Billiton merger in 2001.\n\nThe rationale for and efficacy of the DLC structure have been subject to regular evaluation as the attraction of increased simplification has always been clear. Today’s announced plans, combined with changes over recent years to our portfolio, a significant reduction in earnings contribution from Plc assets as well as a material reduction in the expected costs of unification, have prompted a renewed assessment of the continued suitability of the DLC structure.\n\nThe key benefits of unification comprise:\n\n– a simplified corporate structure which reduces duplication, offers more efficient governance and internal processes and a single measure of value under a unified share register, and\n\n– enhanced strategic flexibility for undertaking future portfolio changes.\n\nA simplified corporate structure with a single unified share register\n\nWe have regularly sought to streamline and improve our corporate and governance processes. Unification would further simplify the BHP corporate structure and shareholder registers, reduce duplication and streamline our governance and internal processes.\n\nUnification will enable one market capitalisation and one global pool of liquidity, with the same share trading via the Group’s listings on the Australian, London and Johannesburg stock exchanges and its NYSE listed ADR program.\n\nUnification will not change BHP's strong fundamentals. It will not change BHP's underlying assets or operations, workforce, executive leadership team, Board or cash flow generation. It will not change our dividend policy or ability to distribute fully franked dividends.\n\nEnhanced strategic flexibility for undertaking future portfolio changes\n\nAs we position the company for the future operating environment, a unified structure will improve flexibility for portfolio reshaping to maximise value for shareholders over the long-term.\n\nCertain equity based acquisitions, demergers and equity raisings will be able to be executed more efficiently. In the near-term, unification of the DLC would facilitate a simpler and more efficient separation of Petroleum.\n\n   19\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nEarnings contribution from Plc assets have significantly reduced\n\nPlc’s earnings have reduced over time relative to Limited’s earnings, due to the divestment of assets previously held by Plc and changes in commodity prices. There have also been increases in overall BHP dividend payments. In recent years, Limited has paid significant dividends to Plc through the DLC Dividend Share. Plc has used the earnings generated by the DLC Dividend Share dividends to pay dividends to its shareholders that match the dividends paid to Limited shareholders. If unification does not occur, BHP expects that the ongoing earnings imbalance between Plc and Limited assets will result in Limited continuing to pay significant DLC Dividend Share dividends to Plc. Any DLC Dividend Share dividends paid by Limited must be franked to the same extent as regular Limited dividends and the franking credits that are attached to these dividends cannot be distributed by Plc to BHP shareholders. Unification will remove the DLC-related constraints on dividend arrangements and result in franked distributions being paid directly to all BHP shareholders.\n\nCosts of unification have materially reduced\n\nThe expected costs associated with unification have significantly reduced as a result of portfolio and corporate structure changes in recent years, including BHP’s settlement of the marketing dispute with the ATO and the recently updated assessment of the likelihood of recovering NSWEC associated tax losses. These changes represent a reduction in unification costs of approximately US$1.2 billion. One-off unification costs are now expected to range between US$400 to US$500 million. In comparison, in 2017 we assessed a loss of value of up to US$3 billion based on a single United Kingdom incorporated company. Under the transaction structure currently contemplated, the most significant component of these expected costs is related to stamp duties levied on Limited as a result of its acquisition of shares in Plc in order to implement unification.\n\nUnification process and timing\n\nUnification is subject to final Board approval, third party consents, regulatory, shareholder and court approvals.\n\nUnification would involve Limited acquiring the shares of Plc and would be implemented by way of an English scheme of arrangement. Unification will require the approval of Plc and Limited shareholders voting separately and UK court approval. If unification is implemented, eligible Plc shareholders would be entitled to receive one Limited share for each Plc share they own. Following unification, both Limited and Plc shareholders would have the equivalent voting and economic interests in BHP as exist under the current DLC structure.\n\nIt is expected that a unified BHP would have its primary listing on the ASX, a standard listing on the LSE, a secondary listing on the JSE, and a sponsored Level II ADR program on the NYSE. A unified BHP would retain inclusion in the S&P/ASX indices. We have started engagement with FTSE Russell and understand that, based on their existing indexation methodology, a unified BHP would not qualify for inclusion in the FTSE UK Index Series. BHP’s corporate and operational presence in Australia, the UK and other key locations are expected to remain unchanged. Following unification, BHP will retain its ongoing commitment to high corporate governance standards. The Board also intends to continue its practice of holding annual director elections.\n\nIf approved, unification is expected to occur in the first half of the 2022 calendar year, with the proposed Petroleum merger with Woodside to follow. Further information about the proposed unification of BHP’s DLC structure will be provided in due course.\n\nUpdate on our non-core coal divestment process\n\nIn August 2020, we announced plans to divest our interests in BHP Mitsui Coal(xv) (BMC), NSWEC and Cerrejón in order to focus our coal portfolio on higher quality metallurgical coals used in steelmaking.\n\nIn June 2021, we announced the signing of a Sale and Purchase Agreement to divest our 33.3 per cent interest in Cerrejón for US$294 million cash consideration. Subject to the satisfaction of customary competition and regulatory requirements, this is expected to complete in the second half of the 2022 financial year.\n\nThe process for BMC and NSWEC is progressing, in line with the two-year timeframe we set last year. We remain open to all options and continue consultation with relevant stakeholders.\n\n    20\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nA stronger and more competitive BHP\n\nThe plans we have announced today will help position BHP for the future. The investment and potential future growth in potash, coupled with the proposed merger of Petroleum with Woodside will result in a portfolio with greater net positive exposure to the mega-trends of decarbonisation and electrification. Copper, potash, nickel, and iron ore all stand to benefit from these trends, as does higher quality metallurgical coal in the near to medium term.\n\nThe proposed unification would further simplify the BHP corporate structure with a single share register. It would also improve strategic flexibility for increasing long-term portfolio exposure towards future facing commodities.\n\nFollowing our investment in Jansen S1, the proposed separation of Petroleum and exit of our non-core coal assets, BHP will be focussed on high quality iron ore and metallurgical coal for the steel that is needed for infrastructure including for renewable energy; copper to support unprecedented demand for renewable energy; nickel for batteries; and potash to make food production and land use more efficient. We will also continue to create and secure further options in future facing commodities\n\nWe are a long-term focused company that creates value and returns over generations for our investors, partners and communities. We do this by striving to be excellent operators, by demonstrating industry leadership in sustainability, by maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation, and by ensuring exposure to commodities that benefit from the mega-trends playing out in the world around us.\n\n21\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nIncome statement\n\nUnderlying attributable profit and Underlying EBITDA are presented below.\n\nUnderlying attributable profit\n\nYear ended 30 June\n\nProfit after taxation attributable to BHP shareholders\n\nTotal exceptional items attributable to BHP shareholders(1) Underlying attributable profit\n\nWeighted basic average number of shares (million)\n\nUnderlying basic earnings per ordinary share\n\n2021 2020 US$M US$M 11,304 7,956 5,773 1,104 17,077 9,060\n\n5,057 5,057\n\n337.7 179.2\n\n                  (1) Refer to page 25 and to note 2 ‘Exceptional items’ and note 8 ‘Significant events – Samarco dam failure’ of the Financial Information for further information.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA\n\nYear ended 30 June\n\nProfit from operations\n\nExceptional items included in profit from operations(1)\n\nUnderlying EBIT\n\nDepreciation and amortisation expense\n\nNet impairments\n\nExceptional item included in Depreciation, amortisation and impairments(2) Underlying EBITDA\n\n2021 US$M 25,906 4,385 30,291 6,824 2,635 (2,371) 37,379\n\n2020 US$M 14,421 1,453 15,874 6,112 494 (409) 22,071\n\n                 (1) Exceptional items loss of US$4,385 million excludes net finance costs of US$85 million related to the Samarco dam failure.

This was partially offset by the acquisition of the additional 28 per cent working interest at Shenzi and increased volumes at Nickel West following resource transition and major quadrennial maintenance shutdowns in the prior period.\n\n(34) Higher inventory drawdowns at Olympic Dam due to stronger mill and smelter performance and at Nickel West as volumes increased following planned maintenance shutdowns in the prior period and additional costs associated with the ramp-up of South Flank. This was largely offset by strong cost performance supported by cost reduction initiatives across our assets, lower technology costs and a gain from the optimised outcome from renegotiation of cancelled power contracts at Escondida and Spence.\n\n109 Lower exploration expenses due to lower seismic activity in Petroleum. 75\n\n(1,588) Impact of the stronger Australian dollar and Chilean peso against the US dollar.

This increase reflected higher depreciation and amortisation at Petroleum following a decrease in estimated remaining reserves at Bass Strait due to underperformance of the reservoir in the Turrum field and lower overall condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) recovery from the Bass Strait gas fields, higher depreciation at WAIO due to a change in Yandi’s life of mine and higher depreciation on right-of-use (lease) assets associated with index-linked freight contracts, including continuous voyage charters (CVCs), as a result of an increase in the prevailing freight index (Baltic C5 index).\n\nNet finance costs\n\nNet finance costs increased by US$394 million to US$1,305 million due to premiums of US$395 million paid as part of the value accretive multi-currency hybrid repurchase programs completed during the year.\n\n24\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n Taxation expense\n\n         Year ended 30 June\n\nStatutory effective tax rate\n\nAdjusted for:\n\nExchange rate movements Exceptional items(1) Adjusted effective tax rate\n\n2021\n\nProfit before Income tax taxation expense US$M US$M 24,601 (11,150)\n\n− (95) 4,470 1,327 29,071 (9,918)\n\n%\n\n45.3\n\n34.1\n\nProfit before taxation US$M 13,510\n\n− 1,546 15,056\n\n2020\n\nIncome tax expense\n\nUS$M %\n\n(4,774) 35.3\n\n20 (241)\n\n(4,995) 33.2\n\n                (1) Refer exceptional items below for further details.\n\nThe Group’s adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements and exceptional items, was 34.1 per cent (2020: 33.2 per cent). The adjusted effective tax rate is above 30 per cent and higher than at 30 June 2020 primarily as a result of higher withholding tax on dividends, driven by higher profitability from our Chilean operations, and current period losses which are not recoverable (including NSWEC and certain Petroleum exploration projects). The adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 32 to 37 per cent for the 2022 financial year.\n\nOther royalty and excise arrangements which are not profit based are recognised as operating costs within Profit before taxation.

A US$2.8 billion reduction was achieved by the completion of two multi-currency hybrid repurchase programs: for US$1.7 billion on 17 September 2020 and US$1.1 billion on 23 November 2020. These programs were funded from surplus cash and were value accretive, with the reduction of future interest costs being higher than the premium paid to repurchase the targeted hybrid notes. An additional US$2.8 billion debt reduction came from the early redemption of hybrid notes including US$1.0 billion of 6.250 per cent hybrid notes on 19 October 2020, US$0.3 billion of 6.750 per cent hybrid notes on 30 December 2020 (the balance following the repurchase programs), and EUR€1.25 billion of 4.750 per cent hybrid notes on 22 April 2021. The redemptions were also completed using surplus cash.\n\nAt the subsidiary level, Escondida borrowed US$550 million to refinance maturing long-term debt during the 2021 financial year.\n\nBHP continues to hold a robust liquidity position with US$15.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The Group also has a US$5.5 billion commercial paper program backed by a US$5.5 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in October 2025.

In the medium term, we expect an increase in unit costs to be maintained at less than US$13 per barrel (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.78) primarily as a result of natural field decline.\n\n          Petroleum unit costs (US$M) H2 FY21\n\nRevenue 2,327\n\nH1 FY21\n\n1,619 789 830 181 29 106 (1) 515 50 10.30\n\nFY21 FY20\n\n3,946 4,070 2,300 2,207 1,646 1,863\n\n296 394 107 110 196 166 (68) 131\n\n1,115 1,062\n\n103 109\n\n10.83 9.74\n\n                Underlying EBITDA\n\nGross costs\n\nLess: exploration expense\n\nLess: freight\n\nLess: development and evaluation Less: other(1)\n\nNet costs\n\nProduction (MMboe, equity share) Cost per Boe (US$)(2)(3)\n\n1,511 816 115 78 90 (67) 600 53 11.32\n\n                                                                 (1) Other includes non-cash profit on sales of assets, inventory movements, foreign exchange, provision for onerous lease contracts and the impact from revaluation of embedded derivatives in the Trinidad and Tobago gas contract.\n\n(2) FY21 based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.75.\n\n(3) FY21 excludes COVID-19 related costs of US$0.27 per barrel of oil equivalent that are reported as exceptional items.\n\nDuring the 2021 financial year, we maintained our record of strong safety and operational performance while delivering several key milestones and outperforming our production and unit cost targets. We demonstrated capital discipline and strengthened our competitiveness through the counter-cyclical acquisition of an increased working interest in Shenzi, resulting in the addition of high margin barrels to the portfolio. We also accelerated our Shenzi infill drilling program to capture commodity price upside, simplified and restructured our organisational model, and continued to de-risk and improve the competitiveness of our growth options and future opportunities.\n\nWe also completed a transaction in May 2021 transferring our ownership interest in the operated Neptune asset in the Gulf of Mexico to EnVen Energy Ventures, LLC.\n\n28\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\nIn the June 2021 quarter, drilling commenced on the second Shenzi infill well. Drilling of the first Shenzi infill well took place in March 2021, with production expected from both infill wells in the 2022 financial year.\n\nOn 5 August 2021, the Board approved the funding to develop the Shenzi North project, a two-well subsea tie-in to the Shenzi platform. First production is targeted for the 2024 calendar year. Additional plans for the 2022 financial year include advancing Trion into the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) phase, with competitive risk-weighted returns, and progressing the Calypso appraisal program, with the first appraisal well spud in late July 2021. Further targets include a potential Board decision on investment in the Scarborough gas development by the end of the 2021 calendar year, prior to the proposed completion date for the merger with Woodside, and expected first production from Mad Dog Phase 2 in the middle of the 2022 calendar year. Reflecting these projects, as well as natural field decline, average production is expected to increase to approximately 109 MMboe over the medium term.\n\nPetroleum exploration\n\nPetroleum exploration expenditure for the 2021 financial year was US$322 million, of which US$296 million was expensed. An approximately US$540 million exploration and appraisal program is planned for the 2022 financial year. This is an increase of approximately US$200 million and reflects drilling two Calypso appraisal wells in Trinidad and Tobago, and increased exploration drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, we fulfilled our drilling commitments in the Southern licences with the drilling of the Broadside-1 exploration well in the first half of the 2021 financial year. The Transocean drilling rig arrived on location in our Northern licences in June 2021 and commenced drilling the first of the two Calypso gas appraisal wells in July 2021.\n\nIn Mexico, we commenced an Ocean Bottom Node seismic acquisition(xvii) over the Trion field on 9 November 2020, as part of our ongoing evaluation and analysis. The survey was completed in early January 2021 and the results will be incorporated into the current evaluation of the Trion opportunity. In addition, we received formal approval for a 124-day extension for the evaluation and exploration periods through 1 July 2021 and 1 July 2022 respectively, as a result of the suspension of activities in 2020 due to COVID-19.\n\nIn the US Gulf of Mexico, we expanded our acreage position through the acquisition of two blocks in the central regions and three blocks in the western region, aligned with our strategy of growing our Gulf of Mexico heartland.\n\nIn Eastern Canada, we have flexibility on timing with our two licences in the Orphan Basin, while evaluating the farm-out opportunities. The technical evaluation to support exploration well planning is ongoing.\n\n 29\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nFinancial information for Petroleum for the 2021 and 2020 financial years is presented below.\n\n          Year ended\n\n30 June 2021\n\nUS$M Revenue(1)\n\nUnderlying Underlying EBITDA D&A EBIT\n\nNet\n\noperating Capital Exploration Exploration\n\nassets expenditure\n\ngross(2)\n\nto profit(3)\n\n         Australia Production Unit(4) Bass Strait\n\nNorth West Shelf\n\nAtlantis\n\n327 202 1,066 798 893 761 560 401 417 309 231 174 204 80 164 135 Exploration − (296) Other(5) 85 (262)\n\n186 16 64 775 23 1,136 239 522 1,281 162 239 1,109 175 134 970\n\n54 120 1,885 44 36 433 − 135 107 122 (418) 1,148 113 (375) (169) 1,870 432 7,964 − 1 − 1,870 433 7,964 (3) − − 1,867 433 7,964\n\nNet Underlying operating D&A EBIT assets\n\n197 56 289 449 312 1,796 260 471 1,261 175 256 1,061 139 35 550\n\n64 100 1,551 46 46 323 12 99 60 41 (435) 1,227 77 (188) 129\n\n1,460 752 8,247 − (2) − 1,460 750 8,247 (3) − − 1,457 750 8,247\n\n23\n\n 70\n\n104\n\n178\n\n113\n\n308\n\n152\n\n  2\n\n  −\n\n 44\n\n994\n\n  −\n\nShenzi\n\nMad Dog Trinidad/Tobago Algeria\n\n       Total Petroleum from Group production\n\nThird party products\n\nTotal Petroleum\n\nAdjustment for equity accounted investments(6) Total Petroleum statutory result\n\nYear ended\n\n30 June 2020\n\nUS$M Revenue(1) EBITDA\n\n3,947 2,302 11 1 3,958 2,303 (12) (3) 3,946 2,300\n\n994 322 382 −−− 994 322 382\n\nCapital Exploration Exploration\n\n                                            Underlying\n\nexpenditure\n\n6 87 130 197 45 375 46 16 (1) 8 909 −\n\ngross(2)\n\nto profit(3)\n\n         Australia Production Unit(4) Bass Strait\n\nNorth West Shelf\n\nAtlantis\n\nShenzi\n\nMad Dog\n\nTrinidad/Tobago\n\nAlgeria\n\nExploration\n\nOther(5)\n\nTotal Petroleum from Group production\n\nThird party products\n\nTotal Petroleum\n\nAdjustment for equity accounted investments(6) Total Petroleum statutory result\n\n361 253 1,102 761 1,076 731\n\n561 431 277 174 216 164 191 92 159 111\n\n− (394) 104 (111) 4,047 2,212 39 (2) 4,086 2,210 (16) (3) 4,070 2,207\n\n909 564 394 −−− 909 564 394\n\n                                          (1) Total Petroleum statutory result revenue includes: crude oil US$2,013 million (FY2020: US$2,033 million), natural gas US$977 million (FY2020: US$980 million), LNG US$682 million (FY2020: US$774 million), NGL US$212 million (FY2020: US$198 million) and other US$62 million (FY2020: US$85 million) which includes third party products.\n\n(2) Includes US$26 million of capitalised exploration (FY2020: US$170 million).\n\n(3) Includes US$86 million of exploration expenditure previously capitalised, written off as impaired (included in depreciation and amortisation) (FY2020: US$ nil).\n\n(4) Australia Production Unit includes Macedon, Pyrenees and Minerva (divested in December 2019).\n\n(5) Predominantly divisional activities, business development and Neptune (sale finalised in May 2021).

Lower cathode sales at Spence as a result of grade decline and planned maintenance, partially offset by the new stream of concentrate production from the Spence Growth Option that came online in December 2020. Highest annual copper production at Olympic Dam reflected strong performance at the smelter and refinery compared with unplanned downtime at the smelter in the prior period.\n\nHigher inventory drawdowns at Olympic Dam, due to stronger mill and smelter performance compared to the prior period, and at Escondida to offset lower material mined during the period due to a reduced operational workforce. This was partially offset by strong cost performance at Escondida, a US$99 million gain from the optimised outcome from renegotiation of cancelled power contracts at Escondida and Spence, and favourable leach pad inventory movements at Escondida and Spence.\n\nLower deferred stripping depletion at Escondida, reflecting the planned development phase of the mines.\n\nCopper cathodes volume loss at Escondida due to reduced operational workforce as a result of COVID-19.\n\nOther includes increased profit from Antamina driven by higher realised copper and zinc prices, and favourable impacts from lower fuel and energy prices of US$75 million.\n\n                    Escondida unit costs decreased by one per\n\nthroughput, at record levels, as well as lower deferred stripping costs and higher by-product credits. This also reflects a one-off gain from the optimisation of a settlement outcome for the cancellation of power contracts as part of a shift towards 100 per cent renewable energy at Escondida. The strong unit cost result was achieved despite the impact of unfavourable exchange rate movements, a four per cent decline in copper concentrate feed grade and lower cathode volumes as a result of a reduced operational workforce due to COVID-19.\n\nUnit costs in the 2022 financial year are expected to be between US$1.20 and US$1.40 per pound (based on an exchange rate of USD/CLP 727), reflecting expected lower by-product credits, forecast higher costs associated with an approximately 20 per cent increase in material mined required to catch up on mine development due to reduced material movement in the 2021 financial year and study costs to increase optionality at Escondida longer term. This also reflects the inclusion of COVID-19 costs (treated as an exceptional item in the 2021 financial year) and a further decline in concentrator feed grade of approximately two per cent. In the medium term, unit cost guidance remains unchanged at less than US$1.10 per pound (based on an exchange rate of USD/CLP 727).\n\ncent to US$1.00 per pound, reflecting continued strong concentrator\n\n        Escondida unit costs (US$M)\n\nRevenue\n\nUnderlying EBITDA\n\nGross costs\n\nLess: by-product credits Less: freight\n\nNet costs\n\nSales (kt)\n\nSales (Mlb)\n\nCost per pound (US$)(1)(2)(3)\n\nH2 FY21\n\n4,954 3,464 1,490\n\n206 83 1,201 490 1,080 1.11\n\nH1 FY21\n\n4,516 3,019 1,497\n\n272 79 1,146 576 1,270 0.90\n\nFY21\n\n9,470 6,483 2,987\n\n478\n\n162\n\n2,347\n\n1,066 2,350 1.00\n\nFY20\n\n6,719 3,535 3,184\n\n407\n\n178\n\n2,599\n\n1,164 2,567 1.01\n\n                                                                         (1) FY21 based on an average exchange rate USD/CLP 746.\n\n(2) FY21 excludes COVID-19 related costs of US$0.03 per pound that are reported as exceptional items.\n\n(3) FY21 includes a gain from the optimised outcome from renegotiation of cancelled power contracts of US$0.04 per pound.\n\n31\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nOn 13 August 2021, Escondida successfully completed negotiations for a new collective agreement with the Union No1 of Operators and Maintainers, effective for 36 months from 2 August 2021.\n\nThe Spence Growth Option achieved first copper concentrate sales in the March 2021 quarter, after delivering first production in December 2020. Ramp-up to full production remains on track and is expected to be completed by December 2021 despite COVID-19 related impacts, including border restrictions preventing key personnel coming to site. Once ramp-up is completed, Spence is expected to average 300 ktpa of production (including cathodes) over the first four years of operation. The expansion will operate with 100 per cent desalinated water, following the commissioning of a new desalinated water plant, with capacity of 1,000 litres per second. In addition, we are looking at options to use 100 per cent desalinated water in our cathode operations. This follows Escondida’s investment of more than US$4 billion in desalinated water capacity since 2006, which enabled it in December 2019 to eliminate drawdown of water from aquifers for operational supply, 10 years ahead of target.\n\nIn the 2022 financial year, Escondida and Spence will transition to four renewable power contracts to deliver operational flexibility, ensure security of supply and to reduce energy prices at both operations by approximately 20 per cent. We aim to supply Escondida and Spence’s energy requirements from 100 per cent renewable energy sources by the mid-2020s.\n\n Financial information for Copper for the 2021 and 2020 financial years is presented below.\n\n         Year ended\n\n30 June 2021\n\nUS$M Revenue\n\nEscondida(1) 9,470 Pampa Norte(2) 1,801 Antamina(3) 1,627 Olympic Dam 2,211 Other(3)(4) −\n\nUnderlying EBITDA\n\n6,483 954 1,158 598 (230) 8,963 64 9,027 (538) 8,489\n\nUnderlying EBITDA\n\n3,535 599 468 212 (202) 4,612 41 4,653 (306) 4,347\n\nNet\n\nUnderlying operating Capital Exploration\n\nD&A EBIT assets expenditure gross\n\n969 5,514 11,926 666 390 564 4,510 678 142 1,016 1,362 237 313 285 9,045 830\n\n10 (240) 85 7 1,824 7,139 26,928 2,418 − 64 − −\n\n1,824 7,203 26,928 2,418 62 (144) (394) − (238) (9) 1,680 6,809 26,928 2,180 53\n\nNet\n\nUnderlying operating Capital Exploration\n\nD&A EBIT assets expenditure gross\n\n1,143 2,392 12,013 919 316 283 3,187 955 114 354 1,453 205 291 (79) 8,601 538\n\n58 (260) 103 22 1,922 2,690 25,357 2,639 − 41 − −\n\n1,922 2,731 25,357 2,639 62 (165) (141) − (205) (8) 1,757 2,590 25,357 2,434 54\n\nExploration to profit\n\n58 (5) 53\n\nExploration to profit\n\n57 (3) 54\n\n                Total Copper from Group production\n\nThird party products\n\nTotal Copper\n\nAdjustment for equity accounted investments(5) Total Copper statutory result\n\n15,109 2,244 17,353 (1,627) 15,726\n\n                                            Year ended\n\n30 June 2020\n\n(Restated)\n\nUS$M Revenue\n\nEscondida(1) 6,719 Pampa Norte(2) 1,395 Antamina(3) 832 Olympic Dam(6) 1,463 Other(3)(4) −\n\n                Total Copper from Group production\n\nThird party products\n\nTotal Copper\n\nAdjustment for equity accounted investments(5) Total Copper statutory result\n\n10,409 1,089 11,498 (832) 10,666\n\n                                   (1) Escondida is consolidated under IFRS 10 and reported on a 100 per cent basis.\n\n(2) Includes Spence and Cerro Colorado.\n\n(3) Antamina, SolGold and Resolution are equity accounted investments and their financial information presented above with the exception of net operating assets reflects BHP Group’s share.\n\n(4) Predominantly comprises divisional activities, greenfield exploration and business development.

In the medium term, unit costs have been revised to less than US$16 per tonne predominantly reflecting a number of uncontrollable factors including updated guidance exchange rates (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.78), expected higher third party royalties and higher forecast diesel prices.\n\n         Change in other costs:\n\nExchange rates (416) Inflation (60)\n\nOne-off items Other items\n\n(16) 56\n\n      Underlying EBITDA for the year ended\n\n30 June 2021 26,278\n\n  US$14.82 per tonne (or US$12.98 per tonne on a C1 basis excluding a 12 per cent stronger Australian dollar, higher third party royalties,\n\n        WAIO unit costs (US$M) H2 FY21\n\nRevenue 20,345\n\nH1 FY21\n\n13,992 10,220 3,772 826 1,101 1,845 128,273 14.38 12.46\n\nFY21\n\n34,337 26,270 8,067 1,755 2,577 3,735 252,052 14.82 12.98\n\nFY20\n\n20,663 14,508 6,155 1,459 1,531 3,165 250,598 12.63 11.82\n\n                Underlying EBITDA\n\nGross costs\n\nLess: freight\n\nLess: royalties\n\nNet costs\n\nSales (kt, equity share)\n\nCost per tonne (US$)(1)(2)\n\nCost per tonne on a C1 basis excluding third party royalties (US$)(2)(3)\n\n(1) FY21 based on an average exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.75.\n\n16,050 4,295 929 1,476 1,890 123,779 15.27 13.52\n\n                                                          (2) FY21 excludes COVID-19 related costs of US$0.51 per tonne (including US$0.25 per tonne relating to operations and US$0.26 per tonne of demurrage) that are reported as exceptional items.

Lower volumes at Queensland Coal as a result of dragline maintenance, higher strip ratios and lower yields at BMC.\n\n(102) Increased maintenance costs at Queensland Coal (earth moving equipment maintenance and shiploader maintenance at Hay Point port) as well as increased stripping volumes. This was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives at both Queensland Coal and NSWEC.\n\n(512) (55)\n\n148 Other items include favourable impacts from lower fuel and energy prices of US$69 million and other items (predominantly higher profit from Cerrejón of US$54 million due to higher average realised prices).\n\n288\n\n                    Queensland Coal unit costs increased by 21 per cent to US$82 per tonne due to the impact of a 12 per cent stronger Australian dollar, higher planned maintenance in the first half of the year, shiploader maintenance at Hay Point, and lower yields and increased stripping volumes at Poitrel and South Walker Creek. This was partially offset by lower fuel and energy costs, driven by lower diesel prices, and cost reduction initiatives.\n\nUnit costs in the 2022 financial year are expected to be between US$80 and US$90 per tonne (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.78) as a result of expected higher diesel prices. Mine plan optimisation and efficiency uplifts are forecast to largely offset increased stripping requirements. We remain focused on cost reduction and productivity initiatives, however given the ongoing uncertainty regarding restrictions on coal imports into China we are unable to provide medium-term volume and unit cost guidance. We are preserving low-cost incremental growth optionality in our portfolio and we will continue with our market responsive approach to bringing on new tonnes into the markets.\n\n        Queensland Coal unit costs (US$M) H2 FY21\n\nRevenue 2,459\n\nH1 FY21\n\n1,856 59 1,797 45 136 1,616 19,030 84.92\n\nFY21\n\n4,315 593 3,722 69 330 3,323 40,619 81.81\n\nFY20\n\n5,357 1,935 3,422\n\n147\n\n498\n\n2,777\n\n41,086\n\n67.59\n\n                Underlying EBITDA\n\nGross costs\n\nLess: freight\n\nLess: royalties\n\nNet costs\n\nSales (kt, equity share) Cost per tonne (US$)(1)(2)\n\n534 1,925 24 194 1,707 21,589 79.07\n\n                                                 (1) FY21 based on an average exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.75.\n\n(2) FY21 excludes COVID-19 related costs of US$0.91 per tonne that are reported as exceptional items.\n\n35\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nNSWEC unit costs increased by 14 per cent to US$64 per tonne due to the impact of a stronger Australian dollar and lower volumes as a result of significant weather impacts, higher strip ratios, an increased proportion of washed coal in response to widening price quality differentials and reduced port capacity following damage to a shiploader at the Newcastle port in November 2020. This was partially offset by lower fuel and energy costs, driven by lower diesel prices, as well as cost reduction initiatives.\n\nUnit costs in the 2022 financial year are expected to be between US$62 and US$70 per tonne (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.78) reflecting a continued focus on higher quality products, mine plan optimisation, productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives.\n\n         NSWEC unit costs (US$M) H2 FY21\n\nRevenue 525\n\nH1 FY21\n\n314 (180) 494 25 469 7,108 65.98\n\nFY21 FY20\n\n839 886 (169) (79) 1,008 965 66 68 942 897 14,626 15,868 64.41 56.53\n\nExploration Exploration gross to profit\n\n20 7 − −\n\n20 7\n\nExploration Exploration gross to profit\n\n22 9 − −\n\n22 9\n\n                Underlying EBITDA\n\nGross costs\n\nLess: royalties\n\nNet costs\n\nSales (kt, equity share)\n\nCost per tonne (US$)(1)(2)\n\n11 514 41 473 7,518 62.92\n\n                                         (1) FY21 based on an average exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.75.\n\n(2) FY21 excludes COVID-19 related costs of US$0.40 per tonne that are reported as exceptional items.\n\nFinancial information for Coal for the 2021 and 2020 financial years is presented below.\n\n         Year ended\n\n30 June 2021\n\nUS$M Revenue\n\nQueensland Coal 4,315 New South Wales Energy Coal(1) 927 Colombia(1)(5) 281 Other(2) −\n\nUnderlying EBITDA\n\n593 (87) 74 (122) 458 − 458 (170)\n\n288\n\nUnderlying EBITDA\n\n1,935 (19) 69 (155) 1,830 − 1,830 (198)\n\n1,632\n\nNet Underlying operating\n\nCapital D&A EBIT assets expenditure\n\n                Total Coal from Group production\n\nThird party products\n\nTotal Coal\n\nAdjustment for equity accounted investments(3)(4)\n\nTotal Coal statutory result\n\n5,523 − 5,523 (369)\n\n5,154\n\n735 (142) 7,843 512 144 (231) (289) 50 86 (12) − 21 14 (136) (42) 18 979 (521) 7,512 601 − − − − 979 (521) 7,512 601 (114) (56) − (22)\n\n865 (577) 7,512 579\n\nNet\n\nUnderlying operating Capital\n\nD&A EBIT assets expenditure\n\n684 1,251 8,168 523 152 (171) 841 73 112 (43) 776 24\n\n11 (166) (276) 8 959 871 9,509 628 − − − − 959 871 9,509 628 (138) (60) − (25)\n\n821 811 9,509 603\n\n                                            Year ended\n\n30 June 2020\n\nUS$M Revenue\n\nQueensland Coal 5,357 New South Wales Energy Coal(1) 972 Colombia(1) 364 Other(2) −\n\n                Total Coal from Group production\n\nThird party products\n\nTotal Coal\n\nAdjustment for equity accounted investments(3)(4)\n\nTotal Coal statutory result\n\n6,693 − 6,693 (451)\n\n6,242\n\n                                   (1) Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group and Cerrejón are equity accounted investments and their financial information presented above with the exception of net operating assets reflects BHP Group’s share.\n\n(2) Predominantly comprises divisional activities and ceased operations.\n\n(3) Total Coal statutory result revenue excludes US$281 million (FY2020: US$364 million) revenue related to Cerrejón.

While BHP continued to report its share of profit and loss within the Coal segment and asset tables, the Group’s investment of US$284 million in Cerrejón has subsequently been classified as ‘Assets held for sale’ and therefore excluded from net operating assets.\n\n36\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nGreenfield minerals exploration\n\nBHP continued to strengthen its portfolio of options in future facing commodities. During the 2021 financial year, greenfield minerals exploration was undertaken on advancing copper targets in Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Canada, Australia and the south-west United States, and nickel targets in Canada and Australia.\n\nSpecifically in copper, we are undertaking target drilling in Chile, Ecuador, Peru and the United States, while further drilling is planned in the coming year in Australia and Mexico. BHP exercised its option to sign a farm-in agreement with Encounter Resources for the early-stage Elliott copper project in Australia (May 2021). At Oak Dam in South Australia, next stage resource definition drilling to inform future design commenced in May 2021.\n\nOur nickel optionality has grown substantively over the last 18 months, and drilling is currently underway on our extensive “Seahorse” land package on southern Western Australia. Elsewhere, we signed an agreement for a nickel exploration alliance with Midland Exploration in Canada (August 2020) and we completed the acquisition of the nickel Honeymoon Well tenements and a 50 per cent interest in the Albion Downs North and Jericho exploration joint ventures (September 2020).\n\nIn addition, on 27 July 2021, we entered into a definitive Support Agreement with Noront Resources (Noront) to make an all-cash takeover offer for Noront. The Noront Board of Directors has unanimously recommended the offer to Noront shareholders. Noront owns an extensive land package that includes the Eagle’s Nest nickel and copper deposit in the James Bay Lowlands, Ontario, in an emerging metals area known as the Ring of Fire.\n\nOur Metals Exploration and Petroleum Exploration teams are collaborating on a global machine learning initiative that we anticipate will further create new insights on high-potential search spaces. This partnership is unlocking previously unrealised synergies that will further allow BHP to define options in future facing commodities.\n\nGroup and unallocated items\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for Group and unallocated items increased by US$693 million to US$24 million in the 2021 financial year due to an increase in EBITDA at Nickel West, higher freight rates for consecutive voyage charter (CVC) voyages on-charged to the businesses, lower technology costs reflecting changes to the technology organisational model in the prior year and a decrease in costs related to the closure and rehabilitation provision for closed mines compared with the prior year.\n\nNickel West’s Underlying EBITDA increased from a loss of US$(37) million to US$259 million for the 2021 financial year, reflecting higher prices and volumes, and lower maintenance costs following the major quadrennial shutdowns in the prior year, as well as lower contractor costs following the transition and ramp up of new mines. This was partially offset by unfavourable exchange rate movements and the adverse impacts of the stronger nickel price on third party concentrate purchase costs.\n\nCommissioning of the Nickel Sulphate plant is now underway, with first production expected in the September 2021 quarter.\n\n37\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nThe Financial Information set out on pages 41 to 61 for the year ended 30 June 2021 has been prepared on the basis of accounting policies and methods of computation consistent with those applied in the 30 June 2020 financial statements contained within the Annual Report of the Group, with the exception of new accounting standards and interpretations which became effective from 1 July 2020 and other changes in accounting policies applied with effect from 1 July 2020.

The system now covers 30 impacted territories (up from 14 territories). More than 10,500 general damages claims have been resolved, in addition to approximately 270,000 claims for temporary interruption to water supplies immediately following the dam failure. The Renova Foundation has continued to assist more than 10,500 families with ongoing financial support.\n\n(xii) Resettlement remains a priority social program for the Renova Foundation and involves ongoing engagement and consultation with many stakeholders. Resettlement works in the municipality of Mariana are continuing with COVID-19 protocols in place. At Bento Rodrigues, civil works and the healthcare facility are complete, while the public school construction is complete and construction of housing is progressing (with 79 houses either complete or under construction). At Paracatu, infrastructure works and the construction of some public buildings and the first houses are underway. At Gesteira, the Renova Foundation is progressing alternatives to urban resettlement, with an option for individual resettlement in which families from the original small community would be able to purchase individual properties.\n\n(xiii) Maintenance capital includes non-discretionary spend for the following purposes: deferred development and production stripping; risk reduction, compliance and asset integrity.\n\n(xiv) TheUS$2.97billioncurrentscopeofworkforJansenispartofapproximatelyUS$4.5billionthathasbeeninvestedontheprojectsince2008 ahead of the sanction decision on Jansen S1.

These statements discuss future expectations concerning the results of assets or financial conditions, or provide other forward-looking information.\n\n 38\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\nThese forward-looking statements are based on the information available as at the date of this release and/or the date of the Group’s planning processes or scenario analysis processes. There are inherent limitations with scenario analysis and it is difficult to predict which, if any, of the scenarios might eventuate. Scenarios do not constitute definitive outcomes for us. Scenario analysis relies on assumptions that may or may not be, or prove to be, correct and may or may not eventuate, and scenarios may be impacted by additional factors to the assumptions disclosed. Additionally, forward looking statements in this release are not guarantees or predictions of future performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements contained in this release. BHP cautions against reliance on any forward-looking statements or guidance, particularly in light of the current economic climate and the significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption arising in connection with COVID-19.\n\nFor example, our future revenues from our assets, projects or mines described in this release will be based, in part, upon the market price of the minerals, metals or petroleum produced, which may vary significantly from current levels. These variations, if materially adverse, may affect the timing or the feasibility of the development of a particular project, the expansion of certain facilities or mines, or the continuation of existing assets.\n\nOther factors that may affect the actual construction or production commencement dates, costs or production output and anticipated lives of assets, mines or facilities include our ability to profitably produce and transport the minerals, petroleum and/or metals extracted to applicable markets; the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the market prices of the minerals, petroleum or metals we produce; activities of government authorities in the countries where we sell our products and in the countries where we are exploring or developing projects, facilities or mines, including increases in taxes; changes in environmental and other regulations, the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business; political uncertainty; labour unrest; and other factors identified in the risk factors discussed in BHP’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‘SEC’) (including in Annual Reports on Form 20-F) which are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\n\nExcept as required by applicable regulations or by law, BHP does not undertake to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.\n\nPast performance cannot be relied on as a guide to future performance.\n\nNo offer of securities\n\nNothing in this release should be construed as either an offer, or a solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell any securities, or a solicitation of any vote or approval, in any jurisdiction, or be treated or relied upon as a recommendation or advice by BHP. No offer of securities shall be made in the United States absent registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, such registration requirements.\n\nReliance on third party information\n\nThe views expressed in this release contain information that has been derived from publicly available sources that have not been independently verified. No representation or warranty is made as to the accuracy, completeness or reliability of the information. This release should not be relied upon as a recommendation or forecast by BHP.\n\nNo financial or investment advice – South Africa\n\nBHP does not provide any financial or investment 'advice' as that term is defined in the South African Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 37 of 2002, and we strongly recommend that you seek professional advice.\n\nBHP and its subsidiaries\n\nIn this release, the terms ‘BHP’, the ‘Company, the ‘Group’, ‘BHP Group’, ‘our business’, ‘organisation’, ‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’ and ourselves’ refer to BHP Group Limited, BHP Group plc and, except where the context otherwise requires, their respective subsidiaries as defined in note 29 ‘Subsidiaries’ in section 5.1 of BHP’s 30 June 2020 Annual Report and Form 20-F. Those terms do not include non-operated assets.\n\nThis release covers BHP’s assets (including those under exploration, projects in development or execution phases, sites and closed operations) that have been wholly owned and/or operated by BHP and that have been owned as a joint venture(1) operated by BHP (referred to in this release as ‘operated assets’ or ‘operations’) during the period from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021. Our functions are also included.\n\nBHP also holds interests in assets that are owned as a joint venture but not operated by BHP (referred to in this release as ‘non-operated joint ventures’ or ‘non-operated assets’). Our non-operated assets include Antamina, Cerrejón, Samarco, Atlantis, Mad Dog, Bass Strait and North West Shelf. Notwithstanding that this release may include production, financial and other information from non-operated assets, non-operated assets are not included in the BHP Group and, as a result, statements regarding our operations, assets and values apply only to our operated assets unless stated otherwise.\n\n(1) References in this release to a ‘joint venture’ are used for convenience to collectively describe assets that are not wholly owned by BHP. Such references are not intended to characterise the legal relationship between the owners of the asset.\n\n 39\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n News release\n\nFurther information on BHP can be found at bhp.com Authorised for lodgement by:\n\nThe Board of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc\n\nMedia Relations\n\nEmail: media.relations@bhp.com Australia and Asia\n\nGabrielle Notley\n\nTel: +61 3 9609 3830 Mobile: +61 411 071 715\n\nUnited Kingdom and South Africa\n\nNeil Burrows\n\nTel: +44 20 7802 7484 Mobile: +44 7786 661 683\n\nNorth America\n\nJudy Dane\n\nTel: +1 713 961 8283 Mobile: +1 713 299 5342\n\nInvestor Relations\n\nEmail: investor.relations@bhp.com Australia and Asia\n\nTara Dines\n\nTel: +61 3 9609 2222 Mobile: +61 499 249 005\n\nUnited Kingdom and South Africa\n\nJames Bell\n\nTel: +44 20 7802 7144 Mobile: +44 7961 636 432\n\nAmericas\n\nBrian Massey\n\nTel: +1 713 296 7919 Mobile: +1 832 870 7677\n\n    BHP Group Limited ABN 49 004 028 077\n\nLEI WZE1WSENV6JSZFK0JC28\n\nRegistered in Australia\n\nRegistered Office: Level 18, 171 Collins Street Melbourne Victoria 3000 Australia\n\nTel +61 1300 55 4757 Fax +61 3 9609 3015\n\nMembers of the BHP Group which is headquartered in Australia\n\nBHP Group Plc Registration number 3196209\n\nLEI 549300C116EOWV835768\n\nRegistered in England and Wales\n\nRegistered Office: Nova South, 160 Victoria Street London SW1E 5LB United Kingdom\n\nTel +44 20 7802 4000 Fax +44 20 7802 4111\n\nFollow us on social media\n\n40\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  BHP\n\nFinancial Information\n\nYear ended 30 June 2021\n\nFor personal use only\n\n41\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n \n\nFinancial Information\n\nContents\n\nFinancial Information\n\nConsolidated Income Statement for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended 30 June 2021 Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 30 June 2021\n\nConsolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\nConsolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year ended 30 June 2021 Notes to the Financial Information\n\nPage\n\n The Financial Information included in this document for the year ended 30 June 2021 is unaudited and has been derived from the draft Financial Report of the Group for the year ended 30 June 2021. The Financial Information does not constitute the Group’s full statutory accounts for the year ended 30 June 2021, which will be approved by the Board, reported on by the auditors, and subsequently filed with the UK Registrar of Companies and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\n\nThe Financial Information set out on pages 41 to 61 for the year ended 30 June 2021 has been prepared on the basis of accounting policies and methods of computation consistent with those applied in the 30 June 2020 Financial Statements contained within the Annual Report of the Group, with the exception of the following:\n\n Adoption of amendments to existing accounting standards and interpretations which became effective from 1 July 2020;\n\n Adoption of the revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting which became effective from 1 July 2020;\n\n Early adoption of amendments to specific International Financial Reporting Standards relating to ‘Interest Rate\n\nBenchmark (IBOR) Reform – Phase 2;\n\n Changes to the Group’s accounting policy for deferred taxes applied from 1 July 2020.\n\nNote 1 ‘Impact of new accounting standards and interpretations and changes in accounting policies’ describes the impact of the above in this Financial Information.\n\nThe comparative figures for the financial years ended 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2019 are not the statutory accounts of the Group for those financial years. Those accounts have been reported on by the company’s auditor (at the relevant time) and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The reports of the auditor were (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying the reports and (iii) did not contain a statement under Section 498(2) or (3) of the UK Companies Act 2006.\n\nAll amounts are expressed in US dollars unless otherwise noted. The Group’s presentation currency and the functional currency of the majority of its operations is US dollars as this is the principal currency of the economic environment in which it operates. Amounts in this Financial Information have, unless otherwise indicated, been rounded to the nearest million dollars.\n\nThe Group has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern over the period to 30 September 2022 (the ‘going concern’ period) and considers it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing this Financial Information. Where applicable, comparative periods have been adjusted to disclose them on the same basis as the current period figures.\n\n42\n\n43 43 44 45 46\n\n47 - 61\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  BHP

accounting policy change has resulted in the following adjustments:\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n\nThe consolidated balance sheet as at 1 July 2019 has been updated for the following:\n\nIncrease in Deferred tax liabilities 1,021 Increase in Goodwill (included within Intangible assets) 950 Decrease in Retained earnings (71)\n\nThe goodwill recognised as a result of the change in accounting policy relates to Olympic Dam and has been tested for impairment in the period, with no impairment charge being required. The comparative balance sheet as at 30 June 2020 has been restated to reflect these amounts.\n\nConsolidated Statement of Changes in Equity\n\nThe consolidated statement of changes in equity as at 1 July 2018 and 1 July 2019 have been updated to reflect the reduction in retained earnings of US$71 million.\n\nConsolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\n\nThe impact of the accounting policy change on the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income is de minimus and therefore the comparative information has not been restated.\n\nConsolidated Cash Flow Statement\n\nThe change in accounting policy has no impact on the consolidated cash flow statement.\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n Notes to the Financial Information\n\n1. Impact of new accounting standards and interpretation and changes in accounting policies\n\nAmended accounting standards\n\nThe adoption of amendments and revisions to accounting pronouncements applicable from 1 July 2020, including the change in definition of a business under the amendments to IFRS 3/AASB 3 ‘Business Combinations’ and revisions to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, did not have a significant impact on the Group’s Financial Statements.\n\nThe Group has early adopted ‘Interest Rate Benchmark (IBOR) Reform – Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9/AASB 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, IAS 39/AASB139 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’; IFRS 7/AASB 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’; IFRS 4/AASB 4 ‘Insurance Contracts’ and IFRS 16/AASB 16 ‘Leases’). These amendments address the financial reporting impacts from IBOR reform and supplement the IBOR Reform Phase 1 amendments to IFRS 7 and IFRS 9 which were early adopted by the Group in the financial year ended 30 June 2020.\n\nThe amendments provide relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging arrangements directly impacted by IBOR reform. In particular, where changes to the Group’s instruments arise solely as a result of these reforms and do not change the economic substance of the Group’s arrangements, the Group is able to maintain its existing hedge relationships and accounting, resulting in no impact on the Group’s hedge accounting. Upon transition to alternative risk-free rates, the Group will seek to apply relief available in IFRS 9 and continue to apply hedge accounting to its hedging arrangements.\n\nChanges in accounting policies\n\nOn 29 April 2020, the IFRS Interpretations Committee issued a decision on the application of IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ when the recovery of the carrying amount of an asset gives rise to multiple tax consequences, concluding that an entity must account for distinct tax consequences separately. As a result, the Group has changed its accounting policy for assets that have no deductible or depreciable amount for income tax purposes, but do have a deductible amount for capital gains tax (CGT) when determining deferred tax. The Group’s policy had been to use only the amount deductible for CGT purposes whereas the Group will now account for the distinct income tax and CGT consequences arising from the expected manner of recovery. The assets impacted by the change predominately relate to mineral rights.\n\n  US$M\n\n    47\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nFinancial Information\n\n2.

The exceptional item reflects the directly attributable COVID-19 pandemic related additional costs for the Group for the year ended 30 June 2021, including costs associated with the increased provision of health and hygiene services, the impacts of maintaining social distancing requirements and demurrage and other standby charges related to delays caused by COVID-19.\n\nImpairment of Energy coal assets\n\nThe Group recognised an impairment charge of US$1,704 million (after tax) in relation to NSWEC reflecting the status of the divestment process and forecast market conditions for thermal coal, the strengthening Australian dollar and changes to the mine plan. In addition, the Group recognised an impairment charge of US$470 million (after tax) for Cerrejón, reflecting the expected net sale proceeds. Refer to note 9 ‘Impairment of non-current assets’ for further information on the pre-tax impairments.\n\nImpairment of Potash assets\n\nThe Group recognised an impairment charge of US$2,065 million (after tax) in relation to Potash. The impairment charge reflects an analysis of recent market perspectives and the value that we would now expect a market participant to attribute to our investments to date.

The transaction has an effective economic date of 31 December 2020. The purchase price is subject to adjustments at transaction completion, which may include an adjustment for any dividends paid by Cerrejón to the Group during the period from signing to completion. An impairment charge of US$466 million (before tax) was recognised in the year ended 30 June 2021 reducing the carrying value of the Group’s investment in Cerrejón at 30 June 2021 to US$284 million, being the agreed sale proceeds of US$294 million adjusted for expected transaction costs.\n\nAt 30 June 2021, the Group’s investment of US$284 million in Cerrejón along with a loan due from Cerrejón of US$40 million, has been classified as ‘Assets held for sale’. Payables owed to Cerrejón of US$17 million have been classified as ‘Liabilities directly associated with the assets held for sale’. Subject to the satisfaction of customary competition and regulatory requirements, the transaction is expected to be completed within 12 months from the balance sheet date.\n\n49\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nFinancial Information\n\n4.

Significant events – Samarco dam failure\n\nOn 5 November 2015, the Samarco Mineração S.A. (Samarco) iron ore operation in Minas Gerais, Brazil, experienced a tailings dam failure that resulted in a release of mine tailings, flooding the communities of Bento Rodrigues, Gesteira and Paracatu and impacting other communities downstream (the Samarco dam failure).\n\nSamarco is jointly owned by BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda (BHP Brasil) and Vale S.A. (Vale). BHP Brasil’s 50 per cent interest is accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture investment. BHP Brasil does not separately recognise its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of Samarco, but instead records the investment as one line on the balance sheet. Each period, BHP Brasil recognises its 50 per cent share of Samarco’s profit or loss and adjusts the carrying value of the investment in Samarco accordingly. Such adjustment continues until the investment carrying value is reduced to US$ nil, with any additional share of Samarco losses only recognised to the extent that BHP Brasil has an obligation to fund the losses. After applying equity accounting, any remaining carrying value of the investment is tested for impairment.\n\nAny charges relating to the Samarco dam failure incurred directly by BHP Brasil or other BHP entities are recognised 100 per cent in the Group’s results.\n\nThe financial impacts of the Samarco dam failure on the Group’s income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement for the year ended 30 June 2021 are shown in the table below and have been treated as an exceptional item.\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n     Year ended 30 June 2021 US$M\n\n34 failure(2) (46)\n\nYear ended 30 June 2020 US$M\n\n489\n\n(64)\n\n(95) 46 (459) − (83) (93) (176) − (176)\n\n(5) − − (137) (142)\n\nYear ended 30 June 2019 US$M\n\n50\n\n(57)\n\n(96) (263) (586)\n\n− (952) (108) (1,060) − (1,060)\n\n4 − −\n\n(629) (625)\n\nFinancial impacts of Samarco dam failure\n\nIncome statement\n\n    Other income(1)\n\nExpenses excluding net finance costs:\n\nCosts incurred directly by BHP Brasil and other BHP entities in relation to the Samarco dam\n\nLoss from equity accounted investments, related impairments and expenses: Samarco impairment expense(3)\n\nSamarco Germano dam decommissioning(4)\n\nSamarco dam failure provision(5)\n\nFair value change on forward exchange derivatives(6) Loss from operations\n\nNet finance costs(7)\n\nLoss before taxation\n\nIncome tax expense(8)\n\nLoss after taxation\n\nBalance sheet movement\n\n(5) Derivatives 136 Tax liabilities (71) Provisions (741)\n\n(111) (15) (1,000) 136 (1,002) (85) (1,087) (71) (1,158)\n\n                Trade and other payables\n\n    Net liabilities\n\n(681)\n\n  53\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n   Financial Information\n\n8.

Significant events – Samarco dam failure (continued)\n\nProvision for Samarco dam failure\n\nOn 2 March 2016, BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale, entered into a Framework Agreement with the Federal Government of Brazil, the states of Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais and certain other public authorities to establish a foundation (Fundação Renova) that is developing and executing environmental and socio-economic programs (Programs) to remediate and provide compensation for damage caused by the Samarco dam failure. Key Programs include those for financial assistance and compensation of impacted persons, including fisherfolk impacted by the dam failure, and those for remediation of impacted areas and resettlement of impacted communities. A committee (Interfederative Committee) comprising representatives from the Brazilian Federal and State Governments, local municipalities, environmental agencies, impacted communities and Public Defence Office oversees the activities of the Fundação Renova in order to monitor, guide and assess the progress of actions agreed in the Framework Agreement. In addition, the 12th Federal Court is supervising the work of the Fundação Renova and the Court’s decisions have been considered in the Samarco dam failure provision change in estimate. Any future decisions will be analysed for impacts on the provision at the time of any decision.\n\nThe term of the Framework Agreement is 15 years, renewable for periods of one year successively until all obligations under the Framework Agreement have been performed. Under the Framework Agreement, Samarco has primary responsibility for funding Fundação Renova’s annual calendar year budget for the duration of the Framework Agreement. The funding amounts for each calendar year will be dependent on the remediation and compensation projects to be undertaken in a particular year. Annual contributions may be reviewed under the Framework Agreement. To the extent that Samarco does not meet its funding obligations, each of BHP Brasil and Vale have secondary funding obligations under the Framework Agreement in proportion to its 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco.\n\nSamarco began to gradually recommence operations in December 2020, however, there remains significant uncertainty regarding Samarco’s long term cash flow generation. In light of these uncertainties and based on currently available information, BHP Brasil’s provision for its obligations under the Framework Agreement Programs is US$2.6 billion before tax and after discounting at 30 June 2021 (30 June 2020: US$1.8 billion).\n\nUnder a Governance Agreement ratified on 8 August 2018, BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale were to establish a process to renegotiate the Programs over two years to progress settlement of the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim (described below). Pre-requisites established in the Governance Agreement, for re-negotiation of the Framework Agreement were not implemented during the two year period and on 30 September 2020, Brazilian Federal and State prosecutors and public defenders filed a request for the immediate resumption of the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) claim, which has been suspended from the date of ratification of the Governance Agreement. The claim remains suspended after the parties to the claim agreed to continue the suspension on 19 March 2021. BHP Brasil, Samarco, Vale and Federal and State prosecutors have been engaging in negotiations to seek a definitive and substantive settlement of the obligations under the Framework Agreement and the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim. It is not possible to provide a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential settlement outcomes and there is a risk that a negotiated outcome may be materially higher than amounts currently reflected in the Samarco dam failure provision. Until any revisions to the Programs are agreed, Fundação Renova will continue to implement the Programs in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement and the Governance Agreement.\n\nBHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale are required to maintain security of an amount equal to the Fundação Renova’s annual budget up to a limit of R$2.2 billion (approximately US$440 million). The security currently comprises R$1.3 billion (approximately US$260 million) in insurance bonds and a charge of R$800 million (approximately US$160 million) over Samarco’s assets. A further R$100 million (approximately US$20 million) in liquid assets previously maintained as security was released for COVID-19 related response efforts in Brazil.\n\nSamarco Germano dam decommissioning\n\nSamarco is currently progressing plans for the accelerated decommissioning of its upstream tailings dams (the Germano dam complex). Given the significant uncertainties surrounding Samarco’s long term cash flow generation, BHP Brasil’s provision for a 50 per cent share of the expected Germano decommissioning costs is US$232 million (30 June 2020: US$227 million). The decommissioning is at an early stage and as a result, further engineering work and required validation by Brazilian authorities could lead to changes to estimates in future reporting periods.\n\n55\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nFinancial Information\n\n8. Significant events – Samarco dam failure (continued)\n\n  Key judgements and estimates\n\nJudgements\n\nThe outcomes of litigation are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgement has been applied in assessing the likely outcome of legal claims and determining which legal claims require recognition of a provision or disclosure of a contingent liability. The facts and circumstances relating to these cases are regularly evaluated in determining whether a provision for any specific claim is required.\n\nManagement has determined that a provision can only be recognised for obligations under the Framework Agreement and Samarco Germano dam decommissioning as at 30 June 2021. It is not yet possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures to BHP in connection to the contingent liabilities noted below, given their status.\n\nEstimates\n\nThe provisions for Samarco dam failure and Samarco Germano dam decommissioning currently reflect the estimated remaining costs to complete Programs under the Framework Agreement and estimated costs to complete the Germano dam decommissioning and require the use of significant judgements, estimates and assumptions. Based on current estimates, it is expected that approximately 85 per cent of remaining costs for Programs under the Framework Agreement will be incurred by December 2023.\n\nWhile the provisions have been measured based on latest information available, likely changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods may lead to material revisions to these estimates. However, it is currently not possible to determine what facts and circumstances may change, therefore revisions in future reporting periods due to the key estimates and factors outlined below cannot be reliably measured.\n\nThe key estimates that may have a material impact upon the provisions in the next and future reporting periods include:\n\n number of people eligible for financial assistance and compensation and the corresponding amount of expected compensation; and\n\n costs to complete key infrastructure programs, including resettlement of the Bento Rodrigues, Gesteira and Paracatu communities.\n\nThe provisions may also be affected by factors including but not limited to:\n\n resolution of existing and potential legal claims in Brazil and other jurisdictions, including the impact of ongoing settlement negotiations and outcome of the United Kingdom group action complaint;\n\n potential changes in scope of work and funding amounts required under the Framework Agreement including the impact of the decisions of the Interfederative Committee along with further technical analysis, community participation required under the Governance Agreement and rulings made by the 12th Federal Court;\n\n the outcome of ongoing negotiations with State and Federal Prosecutors, including review of Fundação Renova’s Programs as provided in the Governance Agreement;\n\n actual costs incurred;\n\n resolution of uncertainty in respect of the nature and extent of Samarco’s long term cash generation;\n\n costs to complete the Germano dam decommissioning;\n\n updates to discount and foreign exchange rates; and\n\n the outcomes of Samarco’s judicial restructuring (defined below).\n\nGiven\n\nassumptions and estimates could result in a material impact to the provision in the next and future reporting periods.\n\nthese factors, future actual expenditures may differ from the amounts currently provided and changes to key\n\n56\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n8. Significant events – Samarco dam failure (continued)\n\nContingent liabilities\n\nThe following matters are disclosed as contingent liabilities and given the status of proceedings it is not possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures for BHP, unless otherwise stated. Ultimately, all the legal matters disclosed as contingent liabilities could have a material adverse impact on BHP’s business, competitive position, cash flows, prospects, liquidity and shareholder returns.\n\nFederal Public Prosecution Office claim\n\nBHP Brasil is among the defendants named in a claim brought by the Federal Public Prosecution Office on 3 May 2016, seeking R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) for reparation, compensation and moral damages in relation to the Samarco dam failure.\n\nThe 12th Federal Court previously suspended the Federal Public Prosecution Office claim, including a R$7.7 billion (approximately US$1.5 billion) injunction request. On 30 September 2020, Brazilian Federal and State prosecutors and public defenders filed a request for the immediate resumption of the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) claim, which has been suspended since the date of ratification of the Governance Agreement. The claim remains suspended after the parties to the claim agreed to continue the suspension on 19 March 2021.\n\nBHP Brasil, Samarco, Vale and Federal and State prosecutors have been engaging in negotiations to seek a definitive and substantive settlement of the obligations under the Framework Agreement and the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim. It is not possible to provide a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential settlement outcomes and there is a risk that a negotiated outcome may be materially higher than amounts currently reflected in the Samarco dam failure provision.\n\nUnited States class action complaint – Samarco bond holders\n\nOn 14 November 2016, a putative class action complaint (Bondholder Complaint) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of Samarco’s ten-year bond notes due 2022-2024 between 31 October 2012 and 30 November 2015. The Bondholder Complaint was initially filed against Samarco and the former chief executive officer of Samarco.\n\nThe Bondholder Complaint was subsequently amended to include BHP Group Ltd, BHP Group Plc, BHP Brasil, Vale and officers of Samarco, including four of Vale and BHP Brasil’s nominees to the Samarco Board. On 5 April 2017, the plaintiff discontinued its claims against the individual defendants.\n\nThe complaint, along with a second amended complaint, had previously been dismissed by the court. The plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration, or leave to file a third amended complaint, which was denied by the court on 30 October 2019. The plaintiff appealed this decision, which was affirmed by the court of appeals in March 2021.\n\nAustralian class action complaint\n\nBHP Group Ltd is named as a defendant in a shareholder class action filed in the Federal Court of Australia on behalf of persons who acquired shares in BHP Group Ltd on the Australian Securities Exchange or shares in BHP Group Plc on the London Stock Exchange and Johannesburg Stock Exchange in periods prior to the Samarco dam failure. The amount of damages sought is unspecified.\n\nUnited Kingdom group action complaint\n\nBHP Group Plc and BHP Group Ltd were named as defendants in group action claims for damages filed in the courts of England. These claims were filed on behalf of certain individuals, governments, businesses and communities in Brazil allegedly impacted by the Samarco dam failure. The amount of damages sought in these claims is unspecified. The complaint and a subsequent application for permission to appeal have been dismissed by the court, however an application by the claimants to reopen the proceedings was granted in July 2021, allowing the claimants to appeal previous dismissals of the claim.\n\n57\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nFinancial Information\n\n8. Significant events – Samarco dam failure (continued)\n\nCriminal charges\n\nThe Federal Prosecutors’ Office has filed criminal charges against BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale and certain employees and former employees of BHP Brasil (Affected Individuals) in the Federal Court of Ponte Nova, Minas Gerais. On 3 March 2017, BHP Brasil filed its preliminary defences. The Federal Court terminated the charges against eight of the Affected Individuals. The Federal Prosecutors’ Office has appealed seven of those decisions with hearings of the appeals still pending. BHP Brasil rejects outright the charges against the company and the Affected Individuals and will defend the charges and fully support each of the Affected Individuals in their defence of the charges.\n\nOther claims\n\nCivil public actions filed by State Prosecutors in Minas Gerais (claiming damages of approximately R$7.5 billion, US$1.5 billion), State Prosecutors in Espírito Santo (claiming damages of approximately R$2 billion, US$400 million), and public defenders in Minas Gerais (claiming damages of approximately R$10 billion, US$2 billion), have been consolidated before the 12th Federal Court and suspended. The Governance Agreement provides for a process to review whether these civil public claims should be terminated or suspended.\n\nBHP Brasil is among the companies named as defendants in a number of legal proceedings initiated by individuals, non-governmental organisations, corporations and governmental entities in Brazilian Federal and State courts following the Samarco dam failure. The other defendants include Vale, Samarco and Fundação Renova. The lawsuits include claims for compensation, environmental rehabilitation and violations of Brazilian environmental and other laws, among other matters. The lawsuits seek various remedies including rehabilitation costs, compensation to injured individuals and families of the deceased, recovery of personal and property losses, moral damages and injunctive relief. In addition, government inquiries and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have been commenced by numerous agencies of the Brazilian government and are ongoing.\n\nAdditional lawsuits and government investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure could be brought against BHP Brasil and possibly other BHP entities in Brazil or other jurisdictions.\n\nBHP insurance\n\nBHP has various third party general liability and directors and officers insurances for claims related to the Samarco dam failure made directly against BHP Brasil or other BHP entities, their directors and officers, including class actions. External insurers have been notified of the Samarco dam failure along with the third party claims and class actions referred to above. In the period since the dam failure to 30 June 2021, the Group has recognised US$573 million other income from general liability insurance proceeds relating to the dam failure. Recoveries related to general liability insurance are now considered complete.\n\nAs at 30 June 2021, an insurance receivable has not been recognised for any potential recoveries in respect of ongoing matters.\n\nCommitments\n\nUnder the terms of the Samarco joint venture agreement, BHP Brasil does not have an existing obligation to fund Samarco.\n\nBHP has agreed to fund a total of up to US$765 million for the Fundação Renova programs and Samarco’s working capital during calendar year 2021. This comprises up to US$725 million relating to Fundação Renova programs until 31 December 2021, which will be offset against the Group’s provision for the Samarco dam failure, and a short-term working capital facility of up to US$40 million to be made available to Samarco until 31 December 2021. Amounts related to Fundação Renova and Samarco working capital incurred in the six months to 30 June 2021 have been reflected in the utilisation of the provision and impairment expense respectively disclosed above. Any additional requests for funding or future investment provided would be subject to a future decision by BHP, accounted for at that time.\n\n 58\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n8. Significant events – Samarco dam failure (continued)\n\nSamarco judicial reorganisation\n\nSamarco filed for judicial reorganisation (JR) in April 2021, with the Commercial Courts of Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil (JR Court), after multiple enforcement actions taken by certain creditors of Samarco. Samarco's JR filing followed unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a debt restructure with certain financial creditors and multiple legal actions filed by those creditors which threatened Samarco’s operations. The JR is an insolvency proceeding with a means for Samarco to seek to restructure its financial debts and establish a sustainable financial position that allows Samarco to continue to rebuild its operations and strengthen its ability to meet its Fundação Renova funding obligations. Samarco’s operations are expected to continue during the JR and restructure process. The JR is not expected to affect Samarco’s obligation or commitment to make full redress for the 2015 Fundão dam failure, and is not expected to impact Renova Foundation’s ability to undertake that remediation and compensation. It is not possible to determine the outcomes of the JR or estimate any impact that the reorganisation may have for BHP Brasil, including its share of the Samarco dam failure provisions.\n\n9.

If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income statement so as to reduce the carrying amount in the balance sheet to its recoverable amount.\n\nPreviously impaired assets (excluding goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal of previous impairment at each reporting date. Impairment reversal cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash generating units (CGUs). There were no reversals of impairment in the current or prior year.\n\nHow recoverable amount is calculated\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and its value in use (VIU). For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.\n\n59\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nFinancial Information\n\n9. Impairment of non-current assets (continued)\n\nImpairment of non-current assets\n\nThe Group recognised the following impairments to non-current assets during the year:\n\n     Year ended 30 June 2021\n\nWhat has been recognised?\n\nWhat were the drivers of impairment?\n\nHow were the valuations calculated?\n\nWhat were the significant assumptions and estimates used in the valuations?\n\nNSWEC\n\nAt 30 June 2021, the Group determined the overall recoverable amount of the CGU to be negative US$300 million, resulting in an aggregate impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangibles of US$1,057 million for FY2021.\n\nThe impairment charges reflect the status of the divestment process and the forecast market conditions for Australian thermal coal, the strengthening Australian dollar and changes to the mine plan.\n\nThe 30 June 2021 valuation represents VIU, applying discounted cash flow (DCF) techniques.\n\nThe valuation for NSWEC using\n\nprices, estimated future production volumes and discount rates.\n\nThe valuation for Potash is most sensitive to changes in the long-term potash price outlook and the risking applied to the future development phases of the potash resource.\n\nCerrejón\n\nAt 30 June 2021, the Group determined the recoverable amount to be US$284 million, being the agreed sale proceeds of US$294 million adjusted for expected transaction costs, resulting in an aggregate impairment of US$466 million for FY2021.\n\nOn 28 June 2021, the Group announced that it had signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with Glencore to divest its interest in Cerrejón.\n\nThe 30 June 2021 recoverable amount reflects the expected net sale proceeds of US$284 million.\n\nPotash\n\nAt 30 June 2021, the Group determined the recoverable amount for Potash to be US$3.3 billion resulting in an impairment charge of US$1.3 billion against property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe impairment charge against the Group’s Potash assets reflects an analysis of recent market perspectives and the value that the Group would now expect a market participant to attribute to the Group’s investments to date.\n\nThe 30 June 2021 valuation was determined using FVLCD methodology, applying DCF techniques.\n\n                DCF techniques is most sensitive to changes in energy coal\n\n  10. Business combination\n\nIn October 2020, the Group signed a Membership Interest Purchase and Sale Agreement with Hess Corporation (Hess) to acquire an additional 28 per cent working interest in Shenzi, a six-lease development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The transaction was completed on 6 November 2020 for a purchase price of US$480 million after customary post-closing adjustments.\n\nThe transaction increased the Group’s working interest from 44 per cent to 72 per cent. Shenzi continues to be accounted for as a joint operation because BHP continues to have joint decision-making rights with the other joint venture partner (Repsol). The assets and liabilities related to the acquired interests have been accounted for in line with the principles of IFRS 3/ AASB 3 ‘Business Combinations’ with no remeasurement of the Group’s previously held interest. The acquisition resulted in increases to property plant and equipment of US$642 million, inventory of US$17 million and closure and rehabilitation liabilities of US$179 million.\n\nFair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, approximate the consideration paid to Hess and therefore no goodwill or bargain purchase gain has been recognised for the acquisition.\n\nThere were no other significant acquisitions during the year ended 30 June 2021, year ended 30 June 2020 or year ended 30 June 2019.\n\n60\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n11. Subsequent events\n\nOn 27 July 2021, BHP entered into a definitive Support Agreement with Noront Resources (Noront) to make an all- cash takeover offer for Noront.\n\nOn 17 August 2021, BHP announced a major growth investment in the Jansen Stage 1 potash project, which is aligned with our strategy of growing our exposure to future facing commodities in world class assets.\n\nOn 17 August 2021, BHP announced an agreement to pursue a merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside to create a global top 10 independent energy company with a large-scale portfolio of producing, development and exploration assets.\n\nOn 17 August 2021, BHP announced its intention to realise simplification and enhanced strategic flexibility benefits through unifying our corporate structure under BHP’s existing Australian parent company.\n\nOther than the matters outlined above or elsewhere in this financial information, no matters or circumstances have arisen since the end of the financial year that have significantly affected, or may significantly affect, the operations, results of operations or state of affairs of the Group in subsequent accounting periods.\n\n61\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\n Alternative Performance Measures\n\n  BHP\n\nAlternative Performance Measures\n\nYear ended 30 June 2021\n\n62\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nAlternative Performance Measures\n\nWe use various Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) to reflect our underlying financial performance.\n\nThese APMs are not defined or specified under the requirements of IFRS, but are derived from the Group’s draft Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2021 prepared in accordance with IFRS. The APMs and below reconciliations included in this document for the year ended 30 June 2021 and comparative periods are unaudited. The APMs are consistent with how management review financial performance of the Group with the Board and the investment community.\n\nWe consider Underlying attributable profit to be a key measure that allows for the comparability of underlying financial performance by excluding the impacts of exceptional items. It is also the basis on which our dividend payout ratio policy is applied.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA is a key APM that management uses internally to assess the performance of the Group’s segments and make decisions on the allocation of resources. In the Group’s view, this is a relevant measure for capital intensive industries with long-life assets. Underlying EBITDA and Underlying EBIT are included in the Group’s draft Consolidated Financial Statements, as required by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’.\n\nThe “Definition and calculation of alternative performance measures” section outlines why we believe the APMs are useful and the calculation methodology. We believe these APMs provide useful information, but they should not be considered as an indication of, or as a substitute for, statutory measures as an indicator of actual operating performance (such as profit or net operating cash flow) or any other measure of financial performance or position presented in accordance with IFRS, or as a measure of a company’s profitability, liquidity or financial position.\n\nThe following tables provide reconciliations between the APMs and their nearest respective IFRS measure.\n\nExceptional items\n\nTo improve the comparability of underlying financial performance between reporting periods some of our APMs adjust the relevant IFRS measures for exceptional items. Refer to the Group’s 30 June 2021 Financial Information for further information on exceptional items.\n\nExceptional items are those gains or losses where their nature, including the expected frequency of the events giving rise to them, and impact is considered material to the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The exceptional items included within the Group’s profit for the period are detailed below.\n\n2021 2020 Year ended 30 June US$M US$M Revenue − −\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n

Liability associated with index-linked freight contracts, which are required to be remeasured to the prevailing freight index at each reporting date, are excluded from the net debt calculation due to the short-term volatility of the index they relate to not aligning with how the Group uses net debt for decision making in relation to the Capital Allocation Framework. Net debt includes the fair value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge cash and borrowings to reflect the Group’s risk management strategy of reducing the volatility of net debt caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.\n\nNet debt, along with the gearing ratio, is used to monitor the Group’s capital management by relating net debt relative to equity from shareholders.\n\n   Interest bearing liabilities less liability associated with index-linked freight contracts less cash and cash equivalents less net cross currency and interest rate swaps less net cash management related instruments for the Group at the reporting date.\n\n   Gearing ratio\n\n  Ratio of Net debt to Net debt plus Net assets.\n\n   Net operating assets\n\n  Enables a clearer view of the assets deployed to generate earnings by highlighting the net operating assets of the business separate from the financing and tax balances.

A definition and explanation of each of the Key Indicators are provided in the tables below.\n\nHealth and safety-related metrics\n\nOur highest priority is the safety of our people and the communities in which we operate. This is why are focussed on introducing more reliable and effective controls across our safety risk profile and improving human and organisational performance, enabling our people to work safely each day. Our work in fatality elimination is underpinned by our field leadership program, ensuring our leaders are spending quality time in field engaging with our workforce. The health and safety Key Indicators allow the Board, management, investors and other stakeholders to measure and track health and safety performance at our operated assets.\n\nKey Indicator Calculation methodology\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n      High Potential Injury (HPI)\n\n  High potential injury frequency (HPIF) is an indicator which measures the number of injuries with fatal potential per million hours. HPIFR equals the sum of (lost time cases + restricted work cases + medical treatment cases + first aid cases) x 1,000,000 ÷ total hours worked.\n\nHigh potential injuries remain a primary focus to assess progress against our most important safety objective: to eliminate fatalities.\n\nThe basis of calculation for high potential injuries was revised in FY2020 from event count to injury count as part of a safety reporting methodology improvement. In some events, multiple people are injured.\n\nThis methodology has been prepared in accordance with GRI standard 403-9.\n\n   Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF)\n\n  Total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) is an indicator which measures the number of recordable injuries per million hours. TRIF equals the sum of (fatalities + lost-time cases + restricted work cases + medical treatment cases) x 1,000,000 ÷ total hours worked total exposure hours. BHP adopts the US Government Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines for the recording and reporting of occupational injury and illnesses. TRIF statistics exclude non-operated assets.\n\nYear-on-year improvement of TRIF is one of our five-year sustainability targets and is one of the indicators used to assess our safety performance.\n\nThis methodology has been prepared in accordance with GRI standard 403-9 and OSHA guidelines.\n\n Climate change-related metrics\n\nWe recognise the impacts of climate change may impact BHP in a range of areas. Climate-related risks include the potential physical impacts of acute and chronic risks, and transition impacts arising from the transition to a lower carbon economy. Our climate change Key Indicators help us monitor our climate change commitments to mitigate the risks and potential impacts associated with climate change to BHP, as well as fulfil our regulatory reporting obligations. The Key Indicators allow the Board, management, investors and other stakeholders to measure BHP’s performance against these commitments.\n\n73\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nAlternative Performance Measures\n\n   Key Indicator Calculation methodology\n\n    Operational greenhouse gas emissions\n\nDefinition\n\nScope 1 greenhouse gas emissions are direct emissions from operations that are owned or controlled by BHP, primarily emissions from fuel consumed by haul trucks at our operated assets, as well as fugitive methane emissions from coal and petroleum production at our operated assets. Scope 1 refers to direct GHG emissions from our operated assets.\n\nScope 2 greenhouse gas emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat or cooling that is consumed by operations that are owned or controlled by BHP. Our Scope 2 emissions have been calculated using the market-based method using supplier-specific emission factors unless otherwise specified. A residual mix is currently unavailable to account for voluntary purchases and this may result in double counting between electricity consumers.\n\nScope 1 and 2 emissions have been calculated on an operational control basis in accordance with mandatory minimum performance requirements for HSEC reporting, which are in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol definitions and are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, and in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance.\n\nCalculation methodology\n\nThe emissions figures are calculated using the activity data collected at our operated assets. Activity data is multiplied by an energy content (where necessary) and emission factors to derive the energy consumption and GHG emissions associated with a process or an operation. Examples of activity data include kilowatt- hours of electricity used or quantity of fuel used.\n\nEnergy and Scope 1 emissions for facilities already reporting to mandatory local regulatory programs are required to use the same emission factors and methodologies for reporting under BHP’s operational control boundary. This ensures a single emissions and energy inventory is maintained for consistency and efficiency. Local regulatory programs were applicable to the majority of BHP’s Scope 1 emissions inventory in FY2020 (operational control boundary), as listed in the table below. A local regulatory program in this context refers to any scheme requiring emissions to be calculated using mandated references (e.g. the Green Tax legislation in Chile, which requires emissions to be calculated using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) factors) or mandated emission factors (e.g. the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) Scheme or US EPA GHG reporting program, which publish factors specific to the programs). In the absence of local mandatory regulations, the Australian NGER (Measurement) Determination has been set as the default source for emission factors and methodologies for consistency with the majority of the emissions inventory.\n\n   Asset\n\nEscondida, Pampa Norte Potash – Canada\n\nLocation\n\nChile Canada\n\nLocal regulations\n\nGreen Tax legislation (referencing IPCC factors)\n\nCanadian Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (referencin IPCC factors)\n\n     BMA, BMC, NSW Energy Coal, Olympic Dam, Nickel West, WA Iron ore, Petroleum – Australia\n\nAustralia National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme\n\n        Petroleum – Gulf of Mexico\n\nUSA US EPA GHG reporting program\n\n        Petroleum – Trinidad\n\nTrinidad None\n\n  Scope 2 emissions totals are reported using the market-based method (default calculation approach unless otherwise stated) and the location-based method, as recommended by the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. Definitions of location and market-based reporting used in BHP’s accounting are consistent with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol terminology as follows:\n\n Market-based reporting: Scope 2 GHG emissions based on the generators (and therefore the generation fuel mix from which the reporter contractually purchases electricity and/or is directly provided electricity via a direct line transfer).\n\n Location-based reporting: Scope 2 GHG emissions based on average energy generation emission factors for defined geographic locations, including local, subnational or national boundaries (i.e. grid factors). In the case of a direct line transfer, the location-based emissions are equivalent to the market- based emissions.\n\nFor facilities where market-based reporting is required, electricity emission factors are sourced directly from the supplier in the first instance. An emission factor in the public domain, which is specific to the generation plant supplying the facility, is considered equivalent to a supplier-specific factor in this context.\n\nWhere supplier-specific factors are not available, a default emission factor for off-grid electricity is used\n\n   74\n\ng\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n   Key Indicator Calculation methodology\n\n      instead, as published in local regulations or industry frameworks (or the default off-grid electricity emission factor from the Australian NGER (Measurement) Determination) in the case where no local default is available.\n\nThe location-based method is applied using electricity emission factors for the relevant grid network, as sourced from local regulations, industry frameworks or publications from the local grid administrator.\n\nThese methodologies have been prepared in accordance with GRI standard 305-1 and GRI standard 305-2.\n\nMore information on the calculation methodologies for other reported categories, boundaries assumptions and key references used in the preparation of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data can be found in the BHP Scope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions Calculation Methodology, available at bhp.com/climate.\n\n    Value chain emissions\n\n  Scope 3 emissions have been calculated on a carbon dioxide equivalent basis using methodologies consistent with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (Scope 3 Standard). Scope 3 emissions refers to all other indirect emissions (not included in Scope 2) that occur in BHP’s value chain, primarily emissions resulting from our customers using the fossil fuel commodities and processing the non-fossil fuel commodities we sell, as well as upstream emissions associated with the extraction, production and transportation of the goods, services, fuels and energy we purchase for use at our operated assets; emissions resulting from the transportation and distribution of our products; and operational emissions (on an equity basis) from our non-operated joint ventures. Scope 3 emissions reporting necessarily requires a degree of overlap in reporting boundaries due to our involvement at multiple points in the life cycle of the commodities we produce and consume. A significant example of this is that Scope 3 emissions reported under Category 10: ‘Processing of sold products’ include the processing of our iron ore to steel. This third party activity also consumes metallurgical coal as an input, a portion of which is produced by us. For reporting purposes, we account for Scope 3 emissions from combustion of metallurgical coal with all other fossil fuels under the Category 11: ‘Use of sold products’, such that a portion of metallurgical coal emissions is accounted for under two categories. This is an expected outcome of emissions reporting between the different scopes defined under the standard GHG accounting practices and is not considered to detract from the overall value of our Scope 3 emissions disclosure. This double counting means that the emissions reported under each category should not be added up, as to do so would give an inflated total figure. For this reason, we do not report a total Scope 3 emissions figure.\n\nThe below methodology describes the emissions from Category 10: Processing of sold products and Category 11: Use of sold products. These categories are the most material Scope 3 emission categories and together account for almost 95 per cent of Scope 3 emissions.\n\nCategory 10: Processing of sold products\n\nEmissions from the processing of intermediate products sold in the reporting year by downstream companies (e.g. manufacturers) subsequent to sale by the reporting company.\n\nCalculation methodology\n\nThe average-data method as described in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (Scope 3 Guidance) is used to calculate these emissions, with industry- average emission factors applied to production volumes (on an equity basis) for each commodity to calculate an overall emissions estimate for this category.\n\nAssumptions\n\n To estimate emissions from the processing of iron ore, all iron ore production is assumed to be processed to steel. To estimate the higher-end estimate, the crude steel emission factor is applied to the volume of crude steel produced from BHP’s iron ore.\n\n To estimate the lower-end emissions number from the processing of iron ore, it is assumed that the crude steel emission factor already takes into account emissions from both iron ore and metallurgical coal. Therefore, the crude steel emission factor is apportioned based on the ratio of iron ore and metallurgical coal input to produce 1,000 kilograms of crude steel (based on World Steel Association’s integrated blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace route). The crude steel emission factor is split to estimate the emissions from iron ore and metallurgical coal (calculated in Category 11: Use of sold products). The split factor is applied to the volume of crude steel produced from BHP’s iron ore. The estimated crude steel produced with BHP’s iron ore is significantly higher than with BHP’s metallurgical coal (due to higher iron ore production). Therefore, this approach does not capture third party metallurgical coal emissions in the steelmaking process.\n\n To estimate emissions from the processing of copper, we apply an emission factor for the processing of copper to copper wire (rather than alternative products such as tubes or sheets), as this is the most emissions-intensive process and therefore the most ‘conservative’ assumption.\n\n 75\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nAlternative Performance Measures\n\n   Key Indicator Calculation methodology\n\n      Category 11: Use of sold products\n\nEmissions from the end use of goods and services sold by the reporting company in the reporting year.\n\nCalculation methodology\n\nThe method recommended in the Scope 3 Guidance for ‘direct use-phase’ emissions calculations for ‘Fuels and feedstocks’ is used to calculate these emissions, with industry-average emission factors applied to production volumes (on an equity basis) for each commodity to calculate an overall emissions estimate for this category.\n\nFor the lower-end estimate emissions from metallurgical coal, the average-data method as described in the Scope 3 Guidance is used to calculate these emissions, with industry-average emission factors applied to production volumes (on an equity basis) for metallurgical coal to calculate an overall emissions estimate for this category.\n\nAssumptions\n\n All metallurgical coal (higher end estimate), energy coal, natural gas and petroleum products are assumed to be combusted.\n\n In practice, metallurgical coal is primarily used in steelmaking and a portion of the carbon content remains embedded in the final steel product and is not released to the atmosphere; the quantities involved vary according to the feedstocks, processing technologies and output specifications of the process route used.\n\n To estimate the lower-end emissions number from the use of metallurgical coal, it is assumed that crude steel emission factor already takes into account emissions from both iron ore and metallurgical coal. Therefore, the crude steel emission factor is apportioned based on the ratio of iron ore and metallurgical coal input to produce 1,000 kilograms of crude steel (based on World Steel Association’s integrated blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace route). The crude steel emission factor is split to estimate the emissions from metallurgical coal and iron ore (calculated in Category 10: Processing of sold products). The split factor is applied to the volume of crude steel produced from BHP’s metallurgical coal. It should be noted that in reality, BHP’s metallurgical coal may not end up with the same customer as our iron ore.\n\n All energy coal is assumed to be bituminous, which has a mid-range energy content among the three sub-categories of black coal (the others being sub-bituminous coal and anthracite) listed in the NGER Measurement Determination published by the Australian Government (Australian NGER Determination), from which these emission factors are sourced.\n\n All crude oil and condensates are assumed to be refined and combusted as diesel (rather than alternative products such as gasoline) as the most emissions-intensive, therefore the most conservative assumption. The energy content of the crude oil and condensate volumes is used to estimate the corresponding quantity of diesel that would be produced, assuming that no fuel is ‘lost’ during the refining process.\n\n Emissions from LPG and ethane volumes are included in emissions reported for ‘natural gas liquids’ (NGL) production and are assumed to be combusted with the same NGL emission factors. This assumption has minimal impact on estimated emissions due to the small volumes involved.\n\nThis methodology has been prepared in accordance with GRI standard 305-3.\n\nMore information on the calculation methodologies for other reported categories, boundaries assumptions and key references used in the preparation of our Scope 3 emissions data can be found in the associated BHP Scope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions Calculation Methodology, available at bhp.com/climate.\n\n 76\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nFresh water withdrawals\n\nWe acknowledge the nature of our operations can have significant environmental impacts. Our water withdrawal metrics allow the Board and management to manage and monitor the inherent risks relating to, and any adverse impacts our operations may have on, water resources. They also allow the Board, management, investors and other stakeholders to measure and track our performance towards our water-use commitments. Water withdrawal metrics assist the Board and management in understanding the significance of our water resource use, collectively for the Group and by individual operated assets, and to assess trends over time. It also helps inform investment in infrastructure to reduce water withdrawals and improve efficiency of water use.\n\nKey Indicator Calculation methodology\n\nPeople-related metrics\n\nOur global workforce is the foundation of our business and we believe that supporting the wellbeing of our people and promoting an inclusive and diverse culture are vital for maintaining a competitive advantage. The proportion of the workforce that are female or Indigenous workers are key indicators, which allow the Board, management, investors and other stakeholders to measure and track our near and long-term progress.\n\nKey Indicator Calculation methodology\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n      Fresh water withdrawals\n\n   The volume of freshwater, in megalitres (ML), received and intended for use within the reporting period by the operated asset from the water environment and/or a third party supplier.\n\nFresh water is defined as waters other than seawater, wastewater from third parties and hypersaline groundwater. Freshwater withdrawal also excludes entrained water that would not be available for other uses. These exclusions have been made to align with the target’s intent to reduce the use of freshwater sources subject to competition from other users or the environment.\n\n      Female workforce representation (%)\n\n   The number of female employees as a proportion of the total workforce on the last day of the respective reporting period, used in internal management reporting for the purposes of monitoring progress against our goals.\n\n   Indigenous workforce participation (%)\n\n  The number of Indigenous employees as a proportion of the total workforce in the relevant countries on the last day of the respective reporting period, used in internal management reporting for the purposes of monitoring progress against our goals.\n\nThere is no significant seasonal variation in employment numbers.\n\nThese methodologies have been prepared in accordance with GRI standard 102-8 and GRI standard 405-1.\n\n 77\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n Petroleum reserves and resources, producing assets and project information\n\n  Petroleum reserves and resources, producing assets and project information\n\nYear ended 30 June 2021\n\n78\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nStatement of petroleum resources\n\nThe estimates of Petroleum Reserves and Contingent Resources contained in this presentation are based on, and fairly represent, information and supporting documentation prepared under the supervision of Mr. A. G. Gadgil, who is employed by BHP. Mr. Gadgil is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and has the required qualifications and experience to act as a qualified Petroleum Reserves and Resources evaluator under the ASX Listing Rules. This presentation is issued with the prior written consent of Mr. Gadgil who agrees with the form and context in which the Petroleum Reserves and Contingent Resources are presented. Reserves and Contingent Resources are net of royalties owned by others and have been estimated using deterministic methodology. Aggregates of Reserves and Contingent Resources estimates contained in this presentation have been calculated by arithmetic summation of field/project estimates by category with the exception of the North West Shelf (NWS) Gas Project in Australia. Probabilistic methodology has been utilised to aggregate the NWS Reserves and Contingent Resources for the reservoirs dedicated to the gas project only and represents an incremental 6 MMboe of Proved Reserves. The barrel of oil equivalent conversion is based on 6000 scf of natural gas equals 1 boe. The Reserves and Contingent Resources contained in this presentation are inclusive of fuel required for operations. The respective amounts of fuel for each category are provided by the following table. Production volumes exclude fuel. The custody transfer point(s)/point(s) of sale applicable for each field or project are the reference point for Reserves and Contingent Resources. Reserves and Contingent Resources estimates have not been adjusted for risk. Unless noted otherwise, Reserves and Contingent Resources are as of 30 June 2021. Where used in this presentation, the term Resources represents the sum of 2P reserves and 2C Contingent Resources. BHP estimates Proved Reserve volumes according to SEC disclosure regulations and files these in our annual 20-F report with the SEC. All Unproved volumes are estimated using SPE-PRMS guidelines, which among other things, allow escalations to prices and costs, and as such, would be on a different basis than that prescribed by the SEC, and are therefore excluded from our SEC filings. All Resources and other Unproved volumes may differ from and may not be comparable to the same or similarly-named measures used by other companies. Non-proved estimates are inherently more uncertain than proved.\n\nNet BHP Petroleum Reserves and Contingent Resources (MMboe) as of 30 June 2021\n\nAustralia United States Trinidad & Tobago Mexico Algeria Other BHP Assets Total\n\nBHP Results for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n         Bass\n\nStrait NWS Pyrenees Macedon Scarborough Jupiter Shenzi North Wildling Atlantis Dog + Ruby Calypso Trion ROD\n\n1P 107 151 12 43 0 0 74 0 0 79 137 52 0 0 9 0 665\n\nThebe+ Shenzi Mad Angostura\n\n          2P 179 186 21 54 0 0 105 0 0 175 2C 209 35 16 18 390 142 94 31 64 223\n\n192 86 0 0 13 173 34 409 275 33 365 120 409 275 45\n\n4.2 1.4 0.0 0.0 0.8 6.1 2.3 0.0 0.0 0.8 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 6.1 2.3 0.0 0.0 0.8\n\n0 1011 50 2195 50 3206\n\n0.0 47.3 0.0 62.6 0.2 71.1 0.2 133.7\n\n          2P+2C 387 222\n\nFuel Included Above\n\n1P 9.5 21.4 2P 11.4 26.3 2C 6.8 0.1\n\n2P+2C 18.2 26.5\n\n36 72 390 142 199 31 64 398\n\n0.2 2.8 0.0 0.0 2.9 0.0 0.0 4.0 0.2 5.4 0.0 0.0 3.2 0.0 0.0 7.0 0.0 1.5 43.9 18.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.2 6.9 43.9 18.5 3.2 0.0 0.0 7.0\n\n                                  The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only Proved, Probable and Possible Reserves, and only when such Reserves have been determined in accordance with SEC guidelines.

      "search_text": "  JOINT ANNOUNCEMENT Release Time IMMEDIATE\n\nDate 17 August 2021\n\nWoodside and BHP to create a global energy company\n\nWoodside Petroleum Ltd (“Woodside”) and BHP Group (“BHP”) have entered into a merger commitment deed to combine their respective oil and gas portfolios by an all-stock merger (the “Transaction”) to create a global top 10 independent energy company by production.\n\nOn completion of the Transaction, BHP’s oil and gas business would merge with Woodside, and Woodside would issue new shares to be distributed to BHP shareholders. The expanded Woodside would be owned 52 per cent by existing Woodside shareholders and 48 per cent by existing BHP shareholders. The Transaction is subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of full form transaction documents, and satisfaction of conditions precedent including shareholder, regulatory and other approvals.\n\nWith the combination of two high quality asset portfolios, the proposed merger would create the largest energy company listed on the ASX, with a global top 10 position in the LNG industry by production. The combined company will have a high margin oil portfolio, long life LNG assets and the financial resilience to help supply the energy needed for global growth and development over the energy transition.\n\nAttractive strategic and financial rationale\n\nThe combination of Woodside and BHP’s oil and gas business is expected to deliver substantial value creation for both sets of shareholders from across a range of areas, including:\n\n• Greater scale and diversity of geographies, products and end markets through an attractive and long-life conventional portfolio\n\n• Resilient, high margin operating cash flows to fund shareholder returns and business evolution to support the energy transition\n\n• Strong growth profile with a plan to achieve targeted Scarborough FID in the 2021 calendar year and capacity to phase the most competitive, high-return options within the portfolio\n\n• Proven management and technical capability from both companies\n\n• Shared values and focus on sustainable operations, carbon management and ESG\n\nleadership\n\n• Estimated synergies of more than US$400 million (100 per cent basis, pre-tax) per annum from optimising corporate processes and systems, leveraging combined capabilities and improving capital efficiency on future growth projects and exploration\n\n• Greater financial resilience, relative to Woodside’s and BHP’s standalone petroleum businesses.\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nWoodside CEO and Managing Director Meg O’Neill said, “Merging Woodside with BHP’s oil and gas business delivers a stronger balance sheet, increased cash flow and enduring financial strength to fund planned developments in the near term and new energy sources into the future.\n\n“The proven capabilities of both Woodside and BHP will deliver long-term value for shareholders through our geographically diverse and balanced portfolio of tier 1 operating assets and low-cost and low-carbon growth opportunities.\n\n“The proposed transaction de-risks and supports Scarborough FID later this year and enables more flexible capital allocation. We will continue reducing carbon emissions from the combined portfolio towards Woodside’s ambition to be net zero by 2050.”\n\nBHP CEO Mike Henry said, “The merger of our petroleum assets with Woodside will create an organisation with the scale, capability and expertise to meet global demand for key oil and gas resources the world will need over the energy transition.\n\n“Bringing the BHP and Woodside assets together will provide choice for BHP shareholders, unlock synergies in how these assets are managed and allow capital to be deployed to the highest quality opportunities. The merger will also enable the skills, talent and technology of both organisations to build a resilient future as the world’s needs evolve.”\n\nGreater scale and diversity of geographies, products and end markets to create a long- life conventional portfolio\n\nThis Transaction delivers significant benefits for both Woodside and BHP shareholders by creating a long-life conventional portfolio of scale and diversity of geography, product and end markets.\n\nOn a proforma basis, the combined business will consist of:\n\n• High quality conventional asset base producing around 200 MMboe (FY21 net production)\n\n• Diversified production mix of 46% LNG, 29% oil and condensate and 25% domestic gas and liquids (FY21 net production)\n\n• Wide geographic reach with production from Western Australia, east coast Australia, US Gulf of Mexico, and Trinidad and Tobago with approximately 94% of production (FY21 net production) from OECD nations\n\n• 2P reserves of over 2 billion boe comprising 59% gas, and 41% liquids.\n\nResilient operating cash flows to fund shareholder returns and business evolution to\n\nsupport the energy transition\n\nSignificant operating cash flow will support continued strong returns to shareholders over time. Woodside will maintain its focus on disciplined growth investment and continued dividends. It is expected that Australian shareholders will benefit from the distribution of Woodside’s significant franking credit balance.\n\nStrong growth profile with a plan to achieve targeted Scarborough FID in 2021 and capacity to phase high-return options\n\nThe Transaction will deliver expanded growth optionality for shareholders with the flexibility to phase and selectively progress near and longer term high-return options.\n\n2\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nWoodside and BHP have developed a plan to targeted final investment decision (FID) for Scarborough (Australia) by the end of the 2021 calendar year, prior to the proposed completion date for the merger.\n\nAs part of this plan, Woodside and BHP have agreed an option for BHP to sell its 26.5 per cent interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture to Woodside and its 50 per cent interest in the Thebe and Jupiter joint ventures to Woodside if the Scarborough Joint Venture takes a FID by 15 December 2021. The option is exercisable by BHP in the second half of the 2022 calendar year and if exercised, consideration of US$1 billion is payable to BHP with adjustment from an effective date of 1 July 2021. An additional US$100 million is payable contingent upon a future FID for a Thebe development.\n\nThe Atlantis Phase 3 (US), Mad Dog Phase 2 (US), Shenzi North (US) and Sangomar Field Development Phase 1 (Senegal) projects remain on budget and on track, and along with significant brownfield expansion options, provide opportunity for near- and medium-term growth.\n\nLonger term embedded options include the Wildling (US), Trion (Mexico), Calypso (Trinidad and Tobago) and Browse (Australia) projects. These options offer significant potential growth coupled with multiple exploration opportunities and partnerships.\n\nProven management and technical capability from both companies\n\nThe combined business will benefit from the joint management and technical petroleum expertise of both companies, led by Meg O’Neill as the CEO and Managing Director. Leading HSE performance, LNG production and marketing, deepwater oil development and production, exploration success, and international experience will come together to create a differentiated set of capabilities. These capabilities are further supplemented through investments in technology and low carbon solutions, and strong governance systems. In addition, it is intended that the Woodside Board will appoint a current BHP director as a Woodside director on completion.\n\nShared values and focus on sustainable operations, carbon management and ESG leadership\n\nThe combined business will continue to have an unrelenting focus on safe, sustainable and reliable operations, building on Woodside’s and BHP’s strong track records.\n\nIt will build on Woodside’s existing targets to reduce net emissions by 15 per cent and 30 per cent by 2025 and 2030 respectively, on the pathway to its ambition of net zero by 2050, applying these to the combined portfolio. Progress will be reported on both an operated and non-operated equity emissions basis.\n\nIn support of the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, and to contribute to the energy transition, the combined business will focus on building and maintaining a high return and carbon-resilient portfolio which includes natural gas and new energy technologies. The combined business is expected to generate significant cash flow this decade to support the development of new energy products and low carbon solutions including hydrogen, ammonia and carbon capture and storage (CCS).\n\nSynergies and benefits\n\nThis merger of highly complementary asset portfolios is expected to unlock material synergies. Woodside and BHP have estimated annual synergies to be in excess of US$400 million per annum (100 per cent basis, pre-tax).\n\n3\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nThese synergies are anticipated to come from:\n\n• Optimising corporate processes and operating costs across the entire portfolio\n\n• Leveraging the leading petroleum capabilities of both organisations including technology, operating, sales and marketing, infrastructure and resource development expertise\n\n• Optimising spend on exploration and future growth projects through the development of combined and more capital efficient opportunities.\n\nGreater financial resilience, relative to Woodside and BHP’s standalone petroleum business\n\nOn completion of the Transaction, the combined business’ balance sheet will be strengthened by the resilience the merged portfolio delivers through the cycle. On a proforma basis (12 months to 30 June 2021), the combined business will have:\n\n• A large earnings base with revenue of more than US$8 billion and EBITDA of US$4.7 billion\n\n• Operating cash flows of more than US$3 billion supported by resilient foundation assets\n\n• A strong balance sheet reflected with low gearing of 12%.\n\nMerger mechanics\n\nUnder the proposed transaction, Woodside, or a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodside, will acquire 100 per cent of the issued share capital of BHP Petroleum International Pty Ltd in exchange for shares in Woodside which will deliver 48 per cent to BHP shareholders on completion. Woodside shares will be immediately distributed to BHP shareholders. Woodside will remain listed on the ASX with listings on additional exchanges being considered.\n\nBoth the Woodside and BHP boards of directors confirm their support for the Transaction. The merger is expected to be completed in the second quarter of the 2022 calendar year with an effective date of 1 July 2021.\n\nThe Transaction is subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of full form transaction documents which is targeted for October 2021, and satisfaction of conditions precedent including shareholder, regulatory and other approvals. Under the merger commitment deed, each party has agreed to pursue a merger transaction and agreed to certain exclusivity arrangements and to each pay a reimbursement fee of approximately US$160 million in certain circumstances.\n\nWoodside’s financial advisers are Gresham Advisory Partners Limited and Morgan Stanley Australia Limited, and its legal advisers are King & Wood Mallesons and Vinson & Elkins LLP.\n\nBHP’s financial advisers are J.P. Morgan, Barclays and Goldman Sachs and its lead legal adviser is Herbert Smith Freehills.\n\n4\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nAbout BHP\n\nBHP is the world’s largest diversified natural resources company by market capitalisation with over 80,000 employees and contractors, primarily in Australia and the Americas. BHP’s products are sold worldwide and it is among the world’s top producers of major commodities, including iron ore, copper, nickel and metallurgical coal.\n\nBHP pioneered the development of an oil and gas industry in Australia with the Bass Strait discovery in 1965. The BHP petroleum business now has conventional oil and gas assets in the US Gulf of Mexico, Australia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Algeria, and appraisal and exploration options in Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, western US Gulf of Mexico, Eastern Canada, and Barbados.\n\nThe crude oil and condensate, gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) produced by BHP’s petroleum assets are sold on the international spot market or domestic market. The total gross asset value of the BHP petroleum business as at 30 June 2021 was US$15.4 billion, it contributed US$3.9 billion to BHP group revenue and it generated EBITDA of US$2.3 billion for the year ended 30 June 2021.\n\nAbout Woodside\n\nWoodside led the development of the LNG industry in Australia and is applying this same pioneering spirit to solving future energy challenges.

The expanded Woodside would be owned 52 per cent by existing Woodside shareholders and 48 per cent by existing BHP shareholders. The Transaction is subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of full form transaction documents, and satisfaction of conditions precedent including shareholder, regulatory and other approvals.\n\nWith the combination of two high quality asset portfolios, the proposed merger would create the largest energy company listed on the ASX, with a global top 10 position in the LNG industry by production. The combined company will have a high margin oil portfolio, long life LNG assets and the financial resilience to help supply the energy needed for global growth and development over the energy transition.\n\nAttractive strategic and financial rationale\n\nThe combination of Woodside and BHP’s oil and gas business is expected to deliver substantial value creation for both sets of shareholders from across a range of areas, including:\n\n• Greater scale and diversity of geographies, products and end markets through an attractive and long-life conventional portfolio\n\n• Resilient, high margin operating cash flows to fund shareholder returns and business evolution to support the energy transition\n\n• Strong growth profile with a plan to achieve targeted Scarborough FID in the 2021 calendar year and capacity to phase the most competitive, high-return options within the portfolio\n\n• Proven management and technical capability from both companies\n\n• Shared values and focus on sustainable operations, carbon management and ESG\n\nleadership\n\n• Estimated synergies of more than US$400 million (100 per cent basis, pre-tax) per annum from optimising corporate processes and systems, leveraging combined capabilities and improving capital efficiency on future growth projects and exploration\n\n• Greater financial resilience, relative to Woodside’s and BHP’s standalone petroleum businesses.\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nWoodside CEO and Managing Director Meg O’Neill said, “Merging Woodside with BHP’s oil and gas business delivers a stronger balance sheet, increased cash flow and enduring financial strength to fund planned developments in the near term and new energy sources into the future.\n\n“The proven capabilities of both Woodside and BHP will deliver long-term value for shareholders through our geographically diverse and balanced portfolio of tier 1 operating assets and low-cost and low-carbon growth opportunities.\n\n“The proposed transaction de-risks and supports Scarborough FID later this year and enables more flexible capital allocation. We will continue reducing carbon emissions from the combined portfolio towards Woodside’s ambition to be net zero by 2050.”\n\nBHP CEO Mike Henry said, “The merger of our petroleum assets with Woodside will create an organisation with the scale, capability and expertise to meet global demand for key oil and gas resources the world will need over the energy transition.\n\n“Bringing the BHP and Woodside assets together will provide choice for BHP shareholders, unlock synergies in how these assets are managed and allow capital to be deployed to the highest quality opportunities. The merger will also enable the skills, talent and technology of both organisations to build a resilient future as the world’s needs evolve.”\n\nGreater scale and diversity of geographies, products and end markets to create a long- life conventional portfolio\n\nThis Transaction delivers significant benefits for both Woodside and BHP shareholders by creating a long-life conventional portfolio of scale and diversity of geography, product and end markets.\n\nOn a proforma basis, the combined business will consist of:\n\n• High quality conventional asset base producing around 200 MMboe (FY21 net production)\n\n• Diversified production mix of 46% LNG, 29% oil and condensate and 25% domestic gas and liquids (FY21 net production)\n\n• Wide geographic reach with production from Western Australia, east coast Australia, US Gulf of Mexico, and Trinidad and Tobago with approximately 94% of production (FY21 net production) from OECD nations\n\n• 2P reserves of over 2 billion boe comprising 59% gas, and 41% liquids.\n\nResilient operating cash flows to fund shareholder returns and business evolution to\n\nsupport the energy transition\n\nSignificant operating cash flow will support continued strong returns to shareholders over time. Woodside will maintain its focus on disciplined growth investment and continued dividends. It is expected that Australian shareholders will benefit from the distribution of Woodside’s significant franking credit balance.\n\nStrong growth profile with a plan to achieve targeted Scarborough FID in 2021 and capacity to phase high-return options\n\nThe Transaction will deliver expanded growth optionality for shareholders with the flexibility to phase and selectively progress near and longer term high-return options.\n\n2\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nWoodside and BHP have developed a plan to targeted final investment decision (FID) for Scarborough (Australia) by the end of the 2021 calendar year, prior to the proposed completion date for the merger.\n\nAs part of this plan, Woodside and BHP have agreed an option for BHP to sell its 26.5 per cent interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture to Woodside and its 50 per cent interest in the Thebe and Jupiter joint ventures to Woodside if the Scarborough Joint Venture takes a FID by 15 December 2021. The option is exercisable by BHP in the second half of the 2022 calendar year and if exercised, consideration of US$1 billion is payable to BHP with adjustment from an effective date of 1 July 2021. An additional US$100 million is payable contingent upon a future FID for a Thebe development.\n\nThe Atlantis Phase 3 (US), Mad Dog Phase 2 (US), Shenzi North (US) and Sangomar Field Development Phase 1 (Senegal) projects remain on budget and on track, and along with significant brownfield expansion options, provide opportunity for near- and medium-term growth.\n\nLonger term embedded options include the Wildling (US), Trion (Mexico), Calypso (Trinidad and Tobago) and Browse (Australia) projects. These options offer significant potential growth coupled with multiple exploration opportunities and partnerships.\n\nProven management and technical capability from both companies\n\nThe combined business will benefit from the joint management and technical petroleum expertise of both companies, led by Meg O’Neill as the CEO and Managing Director. Leading HSE performance, LNG production and marketing, deepwater oil development and production, exploration success, and international experience will come together to create a differentiated set of capabilities. These capabilities are further supplemented through investments in technology and low carbon solutions, and strong governance systems. In addition, it is intended that the Woodside Board will appoint a current BHP director as a Woodside director on completion.\n\nShared values and focus on sustainable operations, carbon management and ESG leadership\n\nThe combined business will continue to have an unrelenting focus on safe, sustainable and reliable operations, building on Woodside’s and BHP’s strong track records.\n\nIt will build on Woodside’s existing targets to reduce net emissions by 15 per cent and 30 per cent by 2025 and 2030 respectively, on the pathway to its ambition of net zero by 2050, applying these to the combined portfolio. Progress will be reported on both an operated and non-operated equity emissions basis.\n\nIn support of the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, and to contribute to the energy transition, the combined business will focus on building and maintaining a high return and carbon-resilient portfolio which includes natural gas and new energy technologies.\n\nThe combined business is expected to generate significant cash flow this decade to support the development of new energy products and low carbon solutions including hydrogen, ammonia and carbon capture and storage (CCS).\n\nSynergies and benefits\n\nThis merger of highly complementary asset portfolios is expected to unlock material synergies. Woodside and BHP have estimated annual synergies to be in excess of US$400 million per annum (100 per cent basis, pre-tax).\n\n3\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nThese synergies are anticipated to come from:\n\n• Optimising corporate processes and operating costs across the entire portfolio\n\n• Leveraging the leading petroleum capabilities of both organisations including technology, operating, sales and marketing, infrastructure and resource development expertise\n\n• Optimising spend on exploration and future growth projects through the development of combined and more capital efficient opportunities.\n\nGreater financial resilience, relative to Woodside and BHP’s standalone petroleum business\n\nOn completion of the Transaction, the combined business’ balance sheet will be strengthened by the resilience the merged portfolio delivers through the cycle. On a proforma basis (12 months to 30 June 2021), the combined business will have:\n\n• A large earnings base with revenue of more than US$8 billion and EBITDA of US$4.7 billion\n\n• Operating cash flows of more than US$3 billion supported by resilient foundation assets\n\n• A strong balance sheet reflected with low gearing of 12%.\n\nMerger mechanics\n\nUnder the proposed transaction, Woodside, or a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodside, will acquire 100 per cent of the issued share capital of BHP Petroleum International Pty Ltd in exchange for shares in Woodside which will deliver 48 per cent to BHP shareholders on completion. Woodside shares will be immediately distributed to BHP shareholders. Woodside will remain listed on the ASX with listings on additional exchanges being considered.\n\nBoth the Woodside and BHP boards of directors confirm their support for the Transaction. The merger is expected to be completed in the second quarter of the 2022 calendar year with an effective date of 1 July 2021.\n\nThe Transaction is subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of full form transaction documents which is targeted for October 2021, and satisfaction of conditions precedent including shareholder, regulatory and other approvals. Under the merger commitment deed, each party has agreed to pursue a merger transaction and agreed to certain exclusivity arrangements and to each pay a reimbursement fee of approximately US$160 million in certain circumstances.\n\nWoodside’s financial advisers are Gresham Advisory Partners Limited and Morgan Stanley Australia Limited, and its legal advisers are King & Wood Mallesons and Vinson & Elkins LLP.\n\nBHP’s financial advisers are J.P. Morgan, Barclays and Goldman Sachs and its lead legal adviser is Herbert Smith Freehills.\n\n4\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nAbout BHP\n\nBHP is the world’s largest diversified natural resources company by market capitalisation with over 80,000 employees and contractors, primarily in Australia and the Americas. BHP’s products are sold worldwide and it is among the world’s top producers of major commodities, including iron ore, copper, nickel and metallurgical coal.\n\nBHP pioneered the development of an oil and gas industry in Australia with the Bass Strait discovery in 1965.

Details of the key terms of the Transaction are outlined in the ASX announcement ‘Woodside and BHP to create a global energy company’ released 17 August 2021.\n\n• There is no certainty or assurance that the parties will conclude negotiations and execute definitive transaction documents on the intended schedule or at all. Nevertheless, all information in this presentation is presented on a post-merger, pro forma basis unless indicated to the contrary.\n\nInformation\n\n• This presentation contains information in summary form that is current as of the date of this presentation. This information does not purport to be complete, comprehensive or to comprise all the information which a shareholder or potential investor may require in order to determine whether to deal in any securities. It should be read in conjunction with Woodside’s and BHP’s other announcements released to the Australian Securities Exchange, available at www.asx.com.au.\n\n• This presentation has been prepared by Woodside and includes information provided by BHP (“BHP Information”), including information that relates to BHP petroleum estimates. Although Woodside has taken steps to confirm the BHP Information, it has not independently verified it and expressly disclaims any responsibility for it, to the maximum extent permitted by law. No representation or warranty, express or implied, is made as to the fairness, currency, accuracy, adequacy, reliability or completeness of the BHP Information.\n\n• Woodside has been undertaking a due diligence process in respect of the Transaction, which relies in part on the review of financial and other information provided by BHP.

Woodside as at 31 December 2020, updated by ASX announcement dated 15 July 2021 and adjusted for half-year production to 30 June 2021.\n\n27\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n APPENDIX\n\n 1.\n\nNotes to petroleum resource estimates\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all petroleum resource estimates in this presentation are expressed on a 4. pro forma, post-merger basis as a combination of (by arithmetic summation):\n\na) Woodside petroleum resource estimates sourced from, and quoted as at the balance date\n\n(i.e. 31 December) of the Reserves Statement in Woodside’s most recent Annual Report released to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and available at https://www.woodside.com.au/news-and-media/announcements, net Woodside share at 5. standard oilfield conditions of 14.696 psi (101.325 kPa) and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.56 degrees Celsius). The Woodside Reserves Statement dated 31 December 2020 has been subsequently updated by the information in the ASX announcement dated 15 July 2021; and\n\nb) BHP petroleum resource estimates sourced from, and quoted as at the balance date (i.e.\n\n30 June) of, the Additional Information in BHP’s most recent Annual Report released to ASX. 6.\n\nWoodside reports its reserves net of the fuel and flare required for production, processing and transportation up to a reference point. For Woodside’s offshore oil projects, the reference point is defined as the outlet of the floating production storage and offloading facility (FPSO), while for its onshore gas projects the reference point is defined as the inlet to the downstream (onshore) processing facility.\n\nWoodside uses both deterministic and probabilistic methods for estimation of its petroleum resources at the field and project levels. Unless otherwise stated, all Woodside petroleum estimates reported at the company or region level are aggregated by arithmetic summation by category. Note that the aggregated Proved level may be a very conservative estimate due to the portfolio effects of arithmetic summation.\n\n‘MMboe’ means millions (106) of barrels of oil equivalent. Dry gas volumes, defined as ‘C4 minus’ hydrocarbon components and non-hydrocarbon volumes that are present in sales product, are converted to oil equivalent volumes via a constant conversion factor, which for Woodside is 5.7 Bcf of dry gas per 1 MMboe. Volumes of oil and condensate, defined as ‘C5 plus’ petroleum components, are converted from MMbbl to MMboe on a 1:1 ratio.\n\n 2. 3.\n\nOther than as identified in paragraph 1(a) above, Woodside is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the Woodside Reserves Statement. All the material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the Woodside Reserves Statement continue to apply and have not materially changed.\n\nWoodside has conducted (and is continuing to conduct) due diligence in relation to BHP’s petroleum estimates and the merger transaction but has not independently verified all such information and expressly disclaims any responsibility for it, to the maximum extent permitted by law. No representation or warranty, express or implied, is made as to the fairness, currency, accuracy, adequacy, reliability or completeness of BHP’s petroleum estimates. Given Woodside has not independently validated BHP’s petroleum estimates, it should not be regarded as reporting, adopting or otherwise endorsing those estimates. Woodside is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information in relation to BHP petroleum estimates in the BHP Additional Information.\n\n7. The estimates of Woodside’s petroleum resources are based on and fairly represent information and supporting documentation prepared under the supervision of Mr Jason Greenwald, Woodside’s Vice President Reservoir Management, who is a full-time employee of the company and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Mr Greenwald’s qualifications include a Bachelor of Science (Chemical Engineering) from Rice University, Houston, Texas, and more than 20 years of relevant experience. The estimates have been approved by Mr. Ian Sylvester, Woodside’s Vice President Corporate Reserves.\n\n 28\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n APPENDIX\n\n Additional information for US investors\n\nDisclosure of reserve information and cautionary note to US investors\n\n• Unless expressly stated otherwise, all estimates of oil and gas reserves and contingent resources disclosed in this presentation have been prepared using definitions and guidelines consistent with the 2018 Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)/World Petroleum Council (WPC)/American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG)/Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (SPEE) Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS). Estimates of reserves and contingent resource in this presentation will differ from corresponding estimates prepared in accordance with the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and disclosure requirements of the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), and those differences may be material. For additional information regarding BHP’s reserves, please see BHP’s annual report on Form 20- F filed with the SEC.\n\n• This presentation also includes estimates of contingent resources. Estimates of contingent resources are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and would require substantial capital spending over a significant number of years to implement recovery. Actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered from our properties will differ substantially. In addition, we have made no commitment to drill, and likely will not drill, all of the drilling locations that have been attributable to these quantities.\n\n• In connection with the Transaction, it is expected that a registration statement will be filed with the SEC. Such registration statement will be required to include, among other things, disclosure of reserves and other oil and gas information in accordance with U.S. federal securities law and applicable SEC rules and regulations (collectively, \"SEC requirements\"). The SEC permits oil and gas companies that are subject to domestic issuer reporting requirements under U.S. federal securities law, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only estimated proved, probable and possible reserves that meet the SEC's definitions of such terms. In addition, the registration statement will include notes to the financial statements included therein that include supplementary disclosure in respect of oil and gas activities, including estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserve quantities. This supplementary financial statement disclosure will be presented in accordance with FASB requirements, which align with corresponding SEC requirements concerning reserves estimation and reporting.\n\nNo offer or solicitation\n\n• This communication relates to the proposed Transaction between Woodside and BHP. This communication is not intended to and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval with respect to the Transaction or otherwise, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offer of securities in the United States shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933.\n\nImportant additional information\n\n• In connection with the proposed Transaction, Woodside intends to file with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a registration statement on Form F-4 (the “Registration Statement”) to register the Woodside securities to be issued in connection with the proposed Transaction (including a prospectus therefor). Woodside and BHP also plan to file other documents with the SEC regarding the proposed Transaction. This communication is not a substitute for the Registration Statement or the prospectus or for any other document that Woodside or BHP may file with the SEC in connection with the Transaction. US INVESTORS AND US HOLDERS OF WOODSIDE AND BHP SECURITIES ARE URGED TO READ THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT, PROSPECTUS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION (INCLUDING ALL AMENDMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTS TO THOSE DOCUMENTS) THAT WILL BE FILED WITH THE SEC CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT WOODSIDE, BHP AND THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION. Shareholders will be able to obtain free copies of the Registration Statement, prospectus and other documents containing important information about Woodside and BHP once such documents are filed with the SEC, through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Copies of such documents may also be obtained from Woodside and BHP without charge.\n\n  29\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n APPENDIX\n\n Glossary\n\n$, $m, $B APAC A$, AUD ASX\n\n2P\n\n2C\n\nBcf\n\nboe, MMboe, Bboe CAGR\n\nCCS CCUS\n\nConventional\n\nDES EBITDA\n\nEBITDAX\n\nFEED\n\nFID\n\nFPSO\n\nFPU\n\nFree cash flow\n\nGearing\n\nGOM HOA\n\nUS dollar unless otherwise stated, millions of dollars, billions of dollars Asia-Pacific\n\nAustralian dollar\n\nAustralian Securities Exchange\n\nProved plus Probable reserves\n\nBest Estimate of Contingent resources\n\nBillion cubic feet\n\nBarrel of oil equivalent, million barrels of oil equivalent, billion barrels of oil equivalent Compound annual growth rate\n\nCarbon capture and storage\n\nCarbon capture, utilisation and storage\n\nConventional resources exist in porous and permeable rock with pressure equilibrium.

The Jansen shaft project is 96% complete, and the Trion oil project in Mexico moved into the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) phase and is expected to progress to a Final Investment Decision from mid-calendar year 2022.\n\n The announced agreement to pursue a proposed merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside to create a global top 10 independent energy company is progressing to plan, with full form transaction documents expected in November 2021.\n\n We announced our intention to unify our corporate structure under BHP’s existing Australian parent company subject to final Board and other approvals. Unification would create a simplified structure and enhance strategic flexibility. If approved, unification is expected to occur in March 2022 quarter.\n\n In Petroleum, the Calypso appraisal well Bongos-3 in Trinidad and Tobago spud on 27 July 2021 and encountered hydrocarbons. A side track is currently being drilled to complete the appraisal.\n\n In Copper exploration, BHP exercised its option to form an exploration joint venture with Red Tiger Resources for the Intercept Hill copper project, which borders BHP’s Oak Dam site in South Australia.\n\n     Production Sep Q21 Sep Q21 (vs Sep Q20) (vs Jun Q21)\n\n     Sep Q21 vs Jun Q21 commentary\n\n Petroleum (MMboe) Copper (kt)\n\nIron ore (Mt)\n\nEnergy coal (Mt) Nickel (kt)\n\n27.5 27.5 3% 2%\n\n376.5 376.5 (9%) (7%)\n\n63.3 63.3 (4%) (3%)\n\n4.2 4.2 17% (6%)\n\n17.8 17.8 (20%) (21%)\n\nHigher volumes due to increased production from Ruby and higher seasonal gas demand at Bass Strait, partially offset by lower production at North West Shelf and natural field decline.\n\nLower volumes at Olympic Dam due to the commencement of the planned smelter maintenance campaign, albeit approximately one month delayed due to COVID-19 related border restrictions.\n\nLower volumes reflects planned major maintenance including car dumper one and the impacts of temporary rail labour shortages due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, which have improved during September 2021.\n\nLower volumes at NSWEC due to mining in higher strip ratio areas, partially offset by increased stripping enabled by continued improvement in underlying truck productivity.\n\nLower volumes due to planned maintenance across the supply chain.\n\n              Metallurgical coal (Mt) 8.9 8.9 Lower volumes due to planned maintenance at BMA, a planned longwall move at (9%) (25%) Broadmeadow and mining in higher strip ratio areas at BMC. This was partially offset by record stripping at BMC reflecting a step up in underlying truck productivity at\n\nSouth Walker Creek.\n\n          Group copper equivalent production decreased by 5% in the September 2021 quarter following lower minerals volumes largely a result of planned maintenance.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the quarter ended 30 September 2021 1\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Summary\n\n   BHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry:\n\n“BHP’s operations delivered reliably during the first quarter and we completed planned major maintenance activities across a number of our assets. We continue to skilfully navigate the ongoing challenges of COVID-19.\n\nWe progressed the ramp-up of production of high quality iron ore at South Flank and copper from the Spence Growth Option, and we delivered first nickel sulphate from our new plant at Kwinana.\n\nWe sanctioned the Jansen Stage 1 potash project in Canada, and made a series of targeted investments in copper and nickel exploration in Australia and Canada. These are aligned with our efforts to increase our exposure to future facing commodities and to position the portfolio to continue to deliver attractive returns and long-term value to shareholders.”\n\n Operational performance\n\nProduction and guidance are summarised below.\n\nNote: All guidance is subject to further potential impacts from COVID-19 during the 2022 financial year.\n\n      Sep Production Q21\n\nSep Q21 vs Sep Q20\n\nSep Q21 vs Jun Q21\n\n2% (7%) (1%) (3%) (42%) (1%) (3%) (3%) (3%) 2% (25%) (26%) (6%) (6%) (21%)\n\n15%\n\nCurrent FY22 guidance\n\n99–106 1,590 – 1,760 1,000 – 1,080 330 – 370 140 – 170 120 – 140 249 – 259 246 – 255 278 – 288 3–4 39–44 70–78 13–15 13–15 85–95\n\n      Petroleum (MMboe) Copper (kt)\n\nEscondida (kt) Pampa Norte (kt) Olympic Dam (kt) Antamina (kt)\n\nIron ore (Mt)\n\nWAIO (Mt)\n\nWAIO (100% basis) (Mt) Samarco (Mt)\n\nMetallurgical coal (Mt)\n\nQueensland Coal (100% basis) (Mt)\n\nEnergy coal (Mt)(i) NSWEC (Mt)\n\nNickel (kt)\n\nAssets held for sale\n\nEnergy coal – Cerrejón (Mt)(i)\n\n27.5 3% 376.5 (9%) 243.7 (14%)\n\n67.5 59% 29.5 (43%) 35.8 3% 63.3 (4%) 62.3 (6%) 70.6 (5%)\n\n1.0 100%\n\n8.9 (9%) 15.6 (9%) 4.2 17% 4.2 17% 17.8 (20%)\n\n2.1 98%\n\nUnchanged\n\nUnchanged Unchanged Unchanged Unchanged\n\nUnchanged Unchanged Unchanged\n\nUnchanged\n\nUnchanged Unchanged\n\n                                                                  (i) Cerrejón production guidance has ceased reflecting the announced divestment of our interest in June 2021 and separately from 1 July 2021 until transaction completion.\n\nMajor development projects\n\nvolumes will be reported\n\nDuring the September 2021 quarter, the BHP Board approved an investment of US$5.7 billion (C$7.5 billion) for the Jansen Stage 1 project in Canada and US$544 million for the Shenzi North development project in the US Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAt the end of the September 2021 quarter, BHP had four major projects under development, in petroleum (Mad Dog Phase 2 and Shenzi North development) and potash (Jansen mine shafts and Jansen Stage 1), with a combined budget of US$11.2 billion over the life of the projects.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the quarter ended 30 September 2021 2\n\nn/a\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nCorporate update\n\nIn August 2021, we announced a merger proposal to combine our Petroleum business with Woodside Petroleum Ltd by an all-stock merger, subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of full form transaction documents and satisfaction of conditions precedent including required approvals. The proposed merger would create a global top 10 independent energy company by production and be the largest energy company on the Australian Stock Exchange. Execution of a Share Sale Agreement and Integration and Transition Services Agreement is expected to take place in November 2021. Following receipt of all approvals, the merger is expected to be completed in the second quarter of the 2022 calendar year with an effective date of 1 July 2021. An integration team with representatives from both companies has been established and is progressing integration planning activities, which includes developing a path to unlock estimated synergies of more than US$400 million per annum.\n\nIn August 2021, we also announced that we intend to unify our dual listed company (DLC) structure, subject to final Board approval, third party consents, regulatory, shareholder and court approvals. Unification would result in a corporate structure that is simpler, more efficient and improves portfolio flexibility to maximise value for shareholders over the long-term, including facilitating a simpler separation of Petroleum. Constructive engagement with regulators and third parties continues and the process remains on track. If all approvals are received, unification is expected to occur in the March 2022 quarter.\n\nOn 14 September 2021, BHP released its Climate Transition Action Plan 2021 (CTAP). The CTAP builds on the Climate Change Report we released in September last year and has been designed with reference to the structure of the Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark, which was established in late 2020. It provides an update on BHP’s performance in a format that responds to evolving investor assessment and disclosure frameworks, announces our enhanced position on Scope 3, and continues BHP’s demonstrated and long-term commitment to engagement and transparency on our approach to climate change.\n\nIn October 2021, we entered into renewable energy supply agreements that will see Olympic Dam reduce its operational emissions to zero for 50 per cent of its electricity consumption by 2025, based on current forecast demand. Iberdrola Renewable Energy Park near Port Augusta in South Australia will supply the renewable energy under the agreement and, once in operation in July 2022, will be Australia’s largest solar-wind hybrid plant. This announcement follows BHP’s entry into renewable energy agreements for BHP’s operations in Western Australia, Queensland and Chile.\n\nIn October 2021, we also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with South Korea’s POSCO, one of the world’s largest steelmakers to jointly explore greenhouse gas emissions reduction technologies in the integrated steelmaking value chain.\n\nOur Support Agreement with Noront Resources (Noront) to make an all-cash takeover offer for Noront remains in place. Noront owns an extensive land package that includes the Eagle’s Nest nickel and copper deposit in the James Bay Lowlands, Ontario, in an emerging metals area known as the Ring of Fire.\n\nSamarco’s Judicial Reorganisation process is continuing in the Commercial Courts of Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais. The Judicial Reorganisation is a means for Samarco to restructure its financial debts in order to establish a sustainable independent financial position as Samarco continues to rebuild its operations safely and meet its Renova Foundation obligations.\n\nIn addition, negotiations are ongoing with State and Federal Prosecutors and certain other Brazilian public authorities in relation to the review of the Framework Agreement. The Framework Agreement was entered into between Samarco, Vale and BHP Brasil and the relevant Brazilian authorities in March 2016 and established Foundation Renova to develop and implement environmental and socio-economic programs to remediate and provide compensation for damage caused by the Samarco dam failure. The suspended R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim is under discussion as part of these negotiations, which were provided for in the Governance Agreement signed between the parties in 2018.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the quarter ended 30 September 2021 3\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Petroleum\n\n Production\n\nCrude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (MMboe) Natural gas (bcf)\n\nTotal petroleum production (MMboe)\n\nSep Q21\n\n12.8 88.4 27.5\n\nSep Q21 vs Sep Q20\n\n11% (3%) 3%\n\nSep Q21 vs Jun Q21\n\n4% 0% 2%\n\n                  Petroleum – Total petroleum production increased by three per cent to 28 MMboe. Guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 99 and 106 MMboe.\n\nCrude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production increased by eleven per cent to 13 MMboe, reflecting lower impact from weather events in the Gulf of Mexico, increased volumes from Ruby following first production in May 2021 and the additional 28 percent working interest acquired in Shenzi in November 2020, partially offset by natural field decline across the portfolio.\n\nNatural gas production decreased by three per cent to 88 bcf, reflecting decreased production at North West Shelf and natural field decline across the portfolio, partially offset by increased volumes from Ruby and higher seasonal demand for gas at Bass Strait.\n\nProjects\n\nProject and ownership\n\nMad Dog Phase 2 (US Gulf of Mexico) 23.9% (non-operator)\n\nShenzi North development\n\n(US Gulf of Mexico) 72% (operator)\n\nCapital expenditure US$M\n\n2,154 392\n\nInitial production target date\n\nMid-CY22 CY24\n\nCapacity Progress\n\n          New floating production facility with the capacity to produce up to 140,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n\nA two-well subsea tie-in to the Shenzi platform, with the capacity to produce up to 30,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n\nOn schedule and budget.\n\nThe overall project is 95% complete.\n\nApproved in August 2021.\n\n       On 5 August 2021, we announced an investment of US$544 million for Shenzi North development in the US Gulf of Mexico. The capital expenditure represents a 100 per cent share interest. BHP is the operator and holds a 72 per cent share in Shenzi North. Repsol holds the remaining 28 per cent working interest. First production is targeted for the 2024 calendar year.\n\nWe also announced the approval of US$258 million in capital expenditure to move the Trion oil project in Mexico into the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) phase. The focus of these studies will be on completion of the engineering, commercial arrangements and execution planning required to progress to a Final Investment Decision (FID) from mid-calendar year 2022.\n\nIn the September 2021 quarter, onshore construction and commissioning of the Mad Dog Phase 2 project’s semi- submersible floating production platform, Argos, was completed and it is in the process of being towed to the final location for offshore execution. First production from Mad Dog Phase 2 is expected in the middle of the 2022 calendar year.\n\nIn October 2021, one of the two Shenzi infill wells was brought online and early flowback results looks promising. Both Shenzi infill wells are expected to be online in the 2022 financial year.\n\nEngineering work continues to progress at Scarborough. BHP and Woodside (the operator) have developed a plan towards Scarborough FID by the end of the 2021 calendar year prior to the proposed completion date for the merger. As part of this plan, BHP and Woodside have agreed an option for BHP to divest its 26.5 per cent interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture (JV) to Woodside and 50 per cent interest in the Thebe and Jupiter JVs to Woodside if the Scarborough JV takes a FID by 15 December 2021 and the merger does not proceed.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the quarter ended 30 September 2021 4\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nPetroleum exploration\n\nExploration and appraisal wells drilled during the September 2021 quarter are summarised below.\n\n         Well Location\n\nBongos-3 Trinidad & Tobago Block TTDAA 14\n\nBongos-3X Trinidad & Tobago Block TTDAA 14\n\nBongos-4 Trinidad & Tobago Block TTDAA 14\n\nTarget\n\nLowest hydrocarbons\n\nGas Gas\n\nFormation age\n\nLate Miocene Late Miocene Late Miocene\n\nBHP equity\n\n70% (BHP Operator)\n\n70% (BHP Operator)\n\n70% (BHP Operator)\n\nSpud date\n\n27 July 2021 27 July 2021 6 August 2021\n\nWater depth\n\n2,114 m 2,114 m 2,177 m\n\nTotal well depth\n\n5,360 m 4,197 m(i) 3,368 m\n\nStatus\n\nHydrocarbons encountered\n\nDrilling ahead(i) Suspended(ii)\n\n                            (i) Well depth and status as at 30 September 2021.\n\n(ii) Bongos-4 will resume at completion of Bongos-3X.\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, the Calypso appraisal program is currently underway. The Bongos-3 well was spud on 27 July 2021 and the formation evaluation program was completed on 18 September 2021. The well encountered hydrocarbons and a side track (Bongos-3X) is currently being drilled for further appraisal. The Bongos-4 well was spud on 6 August 2021 and is currently suspended, with operations due to recommence following the completion of Bongos-3X operations.\n\nIn the central Gulf of Mexico, the Wasabi exploration well (GC124-001) was spud on 7 October 2021.\n\nIn Barbados, the government has approved our proposed seismic program and we plan to acquire a 3D seismic survey over a portion of the Bimshire and Carlisle Bay blocks. The survey is expected to commence in the December 2021 quarter.\n\nPetroleum exploration expenditure for the September 2021 quarter was US$87 million, of which US$35 million was expensed. An approximate US$540 million exploration and appraisal program is being executed for the 2022 financial year.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the quarter ended 30 September 2021 5\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Copper\n\n Production\n\nCopper (kt) Zinc (t) Uranium (t)\n\nSep Q21\n\n376.5 33,289 531\n\nSep Q21 vs Sep Q20\n\n(9%)\n\n(3%) (39%)\n\nSep Q21 vs Jun Q21\n\n(7%)\n\n(6%) (14%)\n\n                  Copper – Total copper production decreased by nine per cent to 377 kt. Guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 1,590 and 1,760 kt, with production weighted to the second half of the financial year.\n\nIn the September 2021 quarter, the operating environment for our Chilean assets improved due to high COVID-19 vaccination rates. However, some uncertainty related to COVID-19 impacts remains as the pandemic evolves.\n\nEscondida copper production decreased by 14 per cent to 244 kt due to forecast concentrator feed grade decline. Guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 1,000 and 1,080kt. Decline in concentrator feed grade is expected to be approximately two per cent for the year. Medium term guidance of an annual average of 1.2 Mt of copper production over the next five years remains unchanged, with production expected to be weighted towards the latter years. On 13 August 2021, Escondida successfully completed negotiations for a new collective agreement with the Union No1 of Operators and Maintainers, effective for 36 months from 2 August 2021.\n\nPampa Norte copper production increased by 59 per cent to 68 kt, reflecting the continued ramp-up of the Spence Growth Option (SGO), which has brought on a new concentrate stream. Guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 330 and 370 kt with the new stream of concentrate production at Spence partially offset by a forecast decline in stacking grade at Pampa Norte of approximately 10 per cent. The ramp up to full production capacity at SGO is expected to be complete by December 2021, following which Spence is forecast to average 300 ktpa of production (including cathodes) over the first four years of operation. On 11 September 2021, Cerro Colorado and Union No1 (Operators and Maintainers) reached a new collective agreement, effective for 36 months from 1 September 2021.\n\nOlympic Dam copper production decreased by 43 per cent to 30 kt, reflecting the ramp down and commencement of the major smelter maintenance campaign, approximately one month later than plan due to COVID-19 border restrictions impacting the availability of workforce. The maintenance campaign is expected to complete towards the end of the December 2021 quarter, followed by a ramp up to full capacity by March 2022. Guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 140 and 170 kt.\n\nAntamina copper production increased by three per cent to 36 kt and zinc production decreased by three per cent to 33 kt, reflecting higher copper and lower zinc head grades. Guidance remains unchanged for the 2022 financial year, with copper production of between 120 and 140 kt, and zinc production of between 115 and 130 kt.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the quarter ended 30 September 2021 6\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Iron Ore\n\n Production\n\nIron ore production (kt)\n\nSep Q21\n\n63,299\n\nSep Q21 vs Sep Q20\n\n(4%)\n\nSep Q21 vs Jun Q21\n\n(3%)\n\n          Iron ore – Total iron ore production decreased by four per cent to 63 Mt. Guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 249 and 259 Mt.\n\nWAIO production decreased by six per cent to 62 Mt (71 Mt on a 100 per cent basis), mainly reflecting higher planned maintenance during the quarter, including major maintenance of car dumper one and the train load out at Jimblebar. Temporary rail labour shortages related to COVID-19 related border restrictions also had a minor impact. This was partially offset by strong mine performance and optimisation of Yandi’s end-of-life ramp-down. South Flank ramp up continues, with additional temporary crushing capacity to provide an ore for rail buffer during commissioning. Ramp up to full production capacity of 80 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) over three years remains unchanged.\n\nOn 7 September 2021, BHP received regulatory approval to increase capacity at our Port Hedland operations to 330 Mtpa (100 per cent basis), subject to the outcomes of standard appeals processes. Our near-term focus remains on sustainable achievement of 290 Mtpa, with plans to creep beyond this through productivity in the medium term. To support this on the 13 October 2021, the Board approved a port debottlenecking program which is expected to commence in the December 2021 quarter.\n\nSamarco production was 1.0 Mt following the recommencement of iron ore pellet production at one concentrator in December 2020. Guidance of between 3 and 4 Mt (BHP share) remains unchanged for the 2022 financial year.\n\n  Coal\n\nProduction\n\nMetallurgical coal (kt) Energy coal (kt)\n\nSep Q21\n\n8,850 4,238\n\nSep Q21 vs Sep Q20\n\n(9%) 17%\n\nSep Q21 vs Jun Q21\n\n(25%) (6%)\n\n               Metallurgical coal – Metallurgical coal production decreased by nine per cent to 9 Mt (16 Mt on a 100 per cent basis). Guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 39 and 44 Mt (70 and 78 Mt on a 100 per cent basis), with volumes weighted to the second half of the year following planned maintenance in the September 2021 quarter.\n\nQueensland Coal production decreased as a result of planned wash plant maintenance at Goonyella and Peak Downs, planned dragline maintenance at Caval Ridge and mining in higher strip ratio areas at Poitrel in line with the mine plan. This was partially offset by record stripping at BMC and a significant uplift in truck productivity at South Walker Creek.\n\nEnergy coal – Energy coal production increased by 17 per cent to 4 Mt. Guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 13 and 15 Mt. Following our announcement to divest our interest in Cerrejón in June 2021, Cerrejón volumes are no longer included in energy coal guidance and will be reported separately until transaction completion, which is expected to occur in the second half of the 2022 financial year.\n\nNSWEC production increased as a result of increased stripping volumes enabled by improved truck productivity and reduced wet weather impacts. The shiploader at the Newcastle port, which was damaged in November 2020, is now back in operation and operating at full design capacity.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the quarter ended 30 September 2021 7\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Other\n\n Nickel production\n\nNickel (kt)\n\nSep Q21\n\n17.8\n\nSep Q21 vs Sep Q20\n\n(20%)\n\nSep Q21 vs Jun Q21\n\n(21%)\n\n          Nickel – Nickel West production decreased by 20 per cent to 18 kt, reflecting planned maintenance at the Kalgoorlie Smelter, Kwinana Refinery and the Leinster and Kambalda concentrators in the September 2021 quarter. Guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 85 and 95 kt. The first batch of nickel sulphate crystals were produced in the September 2021 quarter and customer certification is underway. We expect first saleable production in the December 2021 quarter.\n\nPotash – In August 2021, we announced the approval of capital expenditure of US$5.7 billion (C$7.5 billion) for the Jansen Stage 1 project. Construction is expected to take approximately six years, followed by a ramp up period of two years, with first production expected in the 2027 calendar year.\n\nA separate US$2.97 billion scope of work for construction of two shafts and associated infrastructure at the site is 96% complete and is expected to be complete in the 2022 calendar year.\n\nProjects\n\nProject and Capital ownership expenditure US$M\n\nInitial production target date\n\nCY27\n\nCY27\n\nCapacity\n\nInvestment to finish the excavation and lining of the production and service shafts, and to continue the installation of essential surface infrastructure and utilities.\n\nDesign, engineering and construction of an underground potash mine and surface infrastructure, with capacity to produce 4.35 Mtpa.\n\nProgress\n\nThe project is 96% complete.

We have continued to add to our early stage options in future facing commodities. Greenfield minerals exploration is being undertaken on advancing copper targets in Chile, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Canada, Australia and the south-west United States. Nickel targets are also being advanced in Canada and Australia. Specifically in copper, we are undertaking target drilling in Chile, Ecuador and the United States, while further drilling is planned in the 2022 financial year in Australia and Mexico.\n\nOn 14 October 2021, BHP exercised its option to form an exploration joint venture with Red Tiger Resources for the Intercept Hill copper project, which borders Oak Dam in South Australia. BHP’s joint venture interest commences at 65 per cent with the option to earn a further 10 per cent over the next three years. This follows BHP’s completion of Stage 1 of an exploration farm-in agreement with Red Tiger Resources, announced on 31 October 2018.\n\nIn October 2021, BHP also executed its farm-in agreement for the early-stage prospective Elliott copper project in the Northern Territory, Australia. On execution of the agreement, the area of tenements covered had increased by approximately 40 per cent since September 2020, up to 7,200 km2. Under the terms of the agreement, BHP can earn up to 75 per cent interest in Elliott by spending up to A$25 million over 10 years.\n\nAt Oak Dam in South Australia, BHP is continuing next stage resource definition drilling, after commencing the program in May 2021.\n\nIn nickel, additional to our Support Agreement with Noront Resources (Noront) to make an all-cash takeover offer for Noront, our Midland Exploration partners are progressing work towards drill-targets in northern Quebec for nickel sulphides.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the quarter ended 30 September 2021 8\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nVariance analysis relates to the relative performance of BHP and/or its operations during the 2022 financial year compared with the 2021 financial year, unless otherwise noted.

Woodside will acquire the entire share capital of BHP Petroleum International Pty Ltd (BHP Petroleum) in exchange for new Woodside shares.\n\nThe signing of the SSA follows the merger commitment deed announced on 17 August 2021.\n\nOn completion, the Merger will create a global top 10 independent energy company by production and the largest energy company listed on the ASX.1 The combined company will have a high margin oil portfolio, long life LNG assets and the financial resilience to help supply the energy needed for global growth and development over the energy transition.\n\nWoodside CEO Meg O’Neill said the Merger would deliver enduring value for Woodside shareholders and BHP shareholders that receive Woodside shares under the Merger.\n\n“Woodside and BHP’s respective oil and gas portfolios and experienced teams are better together. The combination will deliver the increased scale, diversity and resilience to better navigate the energy transition.\n\n“We will have the balance sheet, cash flow and financial strength to help fund planned developments in the near-term, invest in future energy opportunities and return value to our shareholders through the cycle.\n\n“Our emissions reduction targets will apply to the combined portfolio, supporting our aspiration to be net-zero by 2050 and our strategy to supply lower-carbon energy to our customers across the globe,” she said.\n\nAttractive strategic and financial rationale\n\nThe Merger documented in the SSA today is expected to deliver substantial value creation for both sets of shareholders from across a range of areas, including:\n\n• Greater scale and diversity of geographies, products and end markets through an attractive and long-life conventional portfolio\n\n• Resilient, high margin operating cash flows to fund shareholder returns and business evolution to support the energy transition\n\n• Strong growth profile with capacity to phase the most competitive, high-return options within the portfolio\n\n• Proven management and technical capability from both companies\n\n• Shared values and focus on sustainable operations, carbon management and ESG leadership\n\n• Estimated synergies of more than US$400 million (100 per cent basis, pre-tax) per annum from\n\noptimising corporate processes and systems, leveraging combined capabilities and improving capital\n\nefficiency on future growth projects and exploration\n\n• Greater financial resilience, relative to Woodside’s and BHP’s standalone petroleum businesses.\n\nMerger ratio\n\nOn completion of the Merger, Woodside will issue new shares expected to comprise approximately 48% of all Woodside shares (on a post-issue basis) as consideration for the acquisition of BHP Petroleum. The\n\n1 On a proforma basis for the 12 months to 30 June 2021.\n\n Page 1 of 5\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nMerger ratio is based on the number of Woodside shares at the effective date. The number of new shares issued on completion will be adjusted to reflect shares issued by Woodside under its dividend reinvestment plan after the effective date.\n\nThe new Woodside shares will be distributed to BHP shareholders as an in-specie fully franked dividend.\n\nTiming and completion\n\nCompletion is targeted for Q2 2022. Prior to completion, Woodside and BHP will carry on their respective businesses in the normal course and will put in place appropriate plans to enable a smooth transition of ownership.\n\nThe effective date of the Merger will be 1 July 2021.\n\nOn completion, Woodside will make a cash payment to BHP in relation to cash dividends paid by Woodside between the effective date and completion. BHP will make a cash payment to Woodside for the net cash flow generated by BHP Petroleum between the effective date and completion (or, if that amount is negative, Woodside will make a cash payment to BHP). Where applicable, these amounts will be netted off.\n\nBHP Petroleum will transfer to Woodside on a cash and debt-free basis, based on the balance sheet at the effective date, subject to certain exclusions including legacy assets and liabilities that will remain with BHP.\n\nBHP has agreed to exclusivity arrangements with Woodside. These arrangements do not restrict BHP from considering superior proposals for BHP Petroleum in prescribed circumstances. Woodside has agreed to similar exclusivity arrangements in connection with a competing proposal for Woodside.\n\nWarranties and indemnities\n\nEach party has given the other party certain warranties regarding its business. Woodside has agreed to indemnify BHP for, among other things and subject to certain limitations, decommissioning and environmental liabilities relating to the BHP Petroleum business. BHP has agreed to indemnify Woodside for, among other things and subject to certain limitations, claims in respect of entities and assets not forming part of the Merger.\n\nTermination rights\n\nWoodside and BHP have termination rights (including if the other is subject to a defined material adverse change or specified petroleum reserve reduction) and BHP has a right to terminate upon certain changes to Woodside’s credit rating. Each party has agreed that, if the Merger does not complete, its only recourse is a reimbursement fee of US$160 million payable in certain circumstances, including if Woodside’s board changes, withdraws or qualifies its recommendation that shareholders vote in favour of the Merger (subject to certain exceptions).\n\nConditions\n\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to satisfaction (or waiver where permitted) of conditions precedent by 30 June 2022 or an agreed later date, which include:\n\n• Approval by certain regulatory and competition authorities\n\n• Approval by Woodside shareholders at a general meeting\n\n• Independent experts appointed by Woodside issuing a report concluding that the Merger is in the\n\nbest interests of Woodside shareholders\n\n• Certain registration statements relating to Woodside shares being declared effective by the United\n\nStates Securities and Exchange Commission\n\n• Other conditions customary for a transaction of this nature.\n\nIf a condition precedent has not been satisfied or waived by 30 June 2022 (or an agreed later date) either party may terminate the SSA.\n\nPage 2 of 5\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nIn addition, Woodside and BHP are actively seeking necessary third-party consents resulting from the Merger and are working to secure these consents prior to Woodside shareholders voting to approve the Merger.\n\nThe Woodside shareholder meeting to approve the Merger is targeted for Q2 2022.\n\nThe notice of meeting for the Woodside shareholder meeting will include an independent expert’s report, to be prepared by KPMG Corporate Finance. Gaffney, Cline & Associates Ltd has been appointed as the technical specialist. The independent expert’s report will provide an opinion on whether the Merger is in the best interests of Woodside shareholders and is expected to provide more detail on the respective oil and gas portfolios of Woodside and BHP Petroleum, including decommissioning liabilities and asset valuations.\n\nShare listings and governance\n\nWoodside will retain its primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).\n\nWoodside is currently pursuing a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) through an American depository receipt (ADR) arrangement, with a target of being active by completion. The NYSE listing would provide increased access to international equity and debt markets. Additional secondary listings are being evaluated.\n\nIt is intended that the Woodside Board will appoint a current BHP director as a Woodside director on completion.\n\nIntegration and transition\n\nWoodside and BHP have also executed an integration and transition services agreement (ITSA) which provides for the planning of post-completion integration activities, activities to separate BHP Petroleum and its petroleum business from the BHP Group, and a framework for transition services to be provided by BHP after completion.\n\n Contacts:\n\nINVESTORS\n\nDamien Gare\n\nW: +61 8 9348 4421\n\nM: +61 417 111 697\n\nE: investor@woodside.com.au\n\nMEDIA\n\nChristine Forster\n\nM: +61 484 112 469\n\nE: christine.forster@woodside.com.au\n\nThis ASX announcement was approved and authorised for release by Woodside’s Disclosure Committee.\n\nPage 3 of 5\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\n\nInformation\n\nThis document contains information in summary form that is current as of the date of publication.

Woodside will acquire the entire share capital of BHP Petroleum International Pty Ltd (BHP Petroleum) in exchange for new Woodside shares.\n\nThe signing of the SSA follows the merger commitment deed announced on 17 August 2021.\n\nOn completion, the Merger will create a global top 10 independent energy company by production and the largest energy company listed on the ASX.1 The combined company will have a high margin oil portfolio, long life LNG assets and the financial resilience to help supply the energy needed for global growth and development over the energy transition.\n\nBHP CEO Mike Henry said BHP’s petroleum business and Woodside are better together and will create value for BHP shareholders.\n\n“Merging our petroleum business with Woodside creates a large, more resilient company, better able to navigate the energy transition and grow value while doing so,” he said.\n\n“Through the merger we will provide value and choice for BHP shareholders, and unlock synergies in how these assets are managed.”\n\nAttractive strategic and financial rationale\n\nThe Merger documented in the SSA today is expected to deliver substantial value creation for both sets of shareholders from across a range of areas, including:\n\n• Greater scale and diversity of geographies, products and end markets through an attractive and long-life conventional portfolio\n\n• Resilient, high margin operating cash flows to fund shareholder returns and business evolution to support the energy transition\n\n• Strong growth profile with capacity to phase the most competitive, high-return options within the portfolio\n\n• Proven management and technical capability from both companies\n\n• Shared values and focus on sustainable operations, carbon management and ESG\n\nleadership\n\n• Estimated synergies of more than US$400 million (100 per cent basis, pre-tax) per annum\n\nfrom optimising corporate processes and systems, leveraging combined capabilities and\n\nimproving capital efficiency on future growth projects and exploration\n\n• Greater financial resilience, relative to BHP’s and Woodside’s standalone petroleum\n\nbusinesses\n\n1 On a proforma basis for the 12 months to 30 June 2021.\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nAn alternative option carefully considered by the Board was to implement a demerger through a distribution to shareholders of shares in a newly listed entity. However, while a demerger would result in a strong and financially viable stand-alone entity, the Board determined that the Merger was the best alternative for shareholders given that it would capture the additional value flowing from the advantages and benefits outlined above.\n\nMerger ratio\n\nOn completion of the Merger, Woodside will issue new shares expected to comprise approximately 48% of all Woodside shares (on a post-issue basis) as consideration for the acquisition of BHP Petroleum. The Merger ratio is based on the number of Woodside shares at the effective date. The number of new shares issued on completion will be adjusted to reflect shares issued by Woodside under its dividend reinvestment plan after the effective date.\n\nThe new Woodside shares will be distributed to BHP shareholders as an in-specie fully franked dividend.\n\nTiming and completion\n\nCompletion is targeted for the second quarter of the 2022 calendar year. Prior to completion, BHP and Woodside will carry on their respective businesses in the normal course and, will put in place appropriate plans to enable a smooth transition of ownership.\n\nThe effective date of the Merger will be 1 July 2021.\n\nOn completion, Woodside will make a cash payment to BHP in relation to cash dividends paid by Woodside between the effective date and completion. BHP will make a cash payment to Woodside for the net cash flow generated by BHP Petroleum between the effective date and completion (or, if that amount is negative, Woodside will make a cash payment to BHP). Where applicable, these amounts will be netted off.\n\nBHP Petroleum will transfer to Woodside on a cash and debt-free basis, based on the balance sheet at the effective date, subject to certain exclusions including legacy assets and liabilities that will remain with BHP. In its Financial Report for the half year ending 31 December 2021, BHP expects to present the results of BHP Petroleum as a discontinued operation and the BHP Petroleum balance sheet as held for sale, subject to the status of the Merger’s conditions precedent outlined below.\n\nBHP has agreed to exclusivity arrangements with Woodside. These arrangements do not restrict BHP from considering superior proposals for BHP Petroleum in prescribed circumstances. Woodside has agreed to similar exclusivity arrangements in connection with a competing proposal for Woodside.\n\nWarranties and indemnities\n\nEach party has given the other party certain warranties regarding its business. Woodside has agreed to indemnify BHP for, among other things and subject to certain limitations, decommissioning and environmental liabilities relating to the BHP Petroleum business.

Final investment decisions have also been made by Woodside and the Scarborough Joint Venture.\n\nA US$150 million payment is payable to BHP Petroleum (North West Shelf) Pty Ltd by Woodside upon this Financial Investment Decision (FID) of the Scarborough project pursuant to the 2016 divestment of BHP’s 25 per cent Scarborough Joint Venture interest to Woodside1.\n\nThe approved capital expenditure represents BHP’s 26.5 per cent participating interest in Phase 1 of the upstream development. Woodside holds the remaining 73.5 per cent interest and is the operator of the project.\n\nThe development of the Scarborough field (WA-61-L and WA-62-L titles) comprises 13 subsea wells, a semi-submersible Floating Production Unit and a 430km subsea export pipeline to the Woodside operated Pluto LNG Facility in Karratha in Western Australia. Field development will be completed in two phases with eight wells drilled in Phase 1. The upstream production facilities will be installed to supply 8 Mtpa LNG and 180 TJ/day of domestic gas, with first cargo expected in the 2026 calendar year.\n\nLNG and domestic gas will be processed onshore under a Processing and Services Agreement (PSA) executed today by the Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 Joint Venture Participants, which provides long term access to existing and planned Pluto LNG processing facilities operated by Woodside. The PSA is subject to conditions precedent including regulatory approvals.\n\nScarborough via Pluto will be one of the lowest carbon emissions intensity global LNG projects projected to be in production in 2030 and will have the lowest carbon emissions intensity of an Australian originated LNG project at around 0.5 tonnes CO2 per tonne of LNG2. The project will minimise its greenhouse gas footprint through development of low CO2 reservoir fluids coupled with energy efficient LNG processing, in close proximity to the end market – meeting market demand at lower emissions intensity.\n\nPhase 1 of the Scarborough upstream project was approved by BHP following a thorough evaluation of its risk and return metrics, including the economics and technical assessment of the integrated project, under BHP’s Capital Allocation Framework and seeks to create long- term, sustainable value and returns for shareholders.\n\n1 If the proposed merger with Woodside completes, the US$150m FID payment would be included in the net cash flow that accrues to Woodside from the merger effective date of 1 July 2021.\n\n2 Represents CO2 associated with production, liquefaction and shipping.\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nOn completion of the proposed merger, BHP shareholders will benefit from exposure to the fully integrated value chain of both the upstream project and the downstream Pluto LNG processing facilities due to their approximate 48 per cent shareholding in Woodside.\n\nThe integrated project offers stable returns with an unlevered IRR of 13 per cent3, a payback of approximately six years from first production4 and a low breakeven LNG price of less than US$7/MMbtu5. The integrated project will benefit from the brownfield expansion of the existing downstream Pluto LNG processing facilities.\n\nBHP CEO Mike Henry said: “Scarborough will be amongst the lowest carbon incremental sources of LNG to world markets.\n\n“Scarborough will provide a reliable source of LNG for global customers and secure gas supply for the domestic market, as well as ongoing employment in Western Australia.\n\n“Scarborough will provide important cash flows and value for shareholders of the enlarged Woodside.”\n\nIn addition to the approval of the Scarborough development announced today, BHP also holds an option for it to sell its 26.5 per cent interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture and its 50 per cent interest in the Thebe and Jupiter Joint Ventures to Woodside if the Scarborough Joint Venture makes a FID for the Scarborough project by 15 December 2021 and the merger does not complete. This option is exercisable by BHP in the second half of the 2022 calendar year. If exercised, consideration of US$1 billion is payable to BHP with adjustment from an effective date of 1 July 2021. The US$150 million payment payable to BHP Petroleum upon FID of the Scarborough project would remain with BHP Petroleum. An additional US$100 million is payable contingent upon a future FID for a Thebe Development.\n\n 3 Based on BHP resource assumptions and does not account for Pluto train 2 sell down or send or pay contractual arrangements; nominal IRR. 4 Based on Wood Mackenzie’s most recent long-term gas price forecast of Japan LNG DES price (2026-2035 average: US$8.35/MMBtu, real\n\n2021).\n\n5 Integrated LNG DES North Asia.

      "search_text": "  Release Time Date\n\nNumber\n\nIMMEDIATE\n\n2 December 2021 31/21\n\nBHP to proceed with Unification proposal\n\nBHP has today announced a final Board decision to unify BHP’s corporate structure under its existing Australian parent company, BHP Group Limited.\n\nThe Board believes unification is in the best interests of BHP shareholders. It will result in a corporate structure that is simpler and more efficient, reduces duplication and streamlines BHP’s governance and internal processes. A unified structure will also improve flexibility for portfolio reshaping to maximise shareholder value over the long-term, including facilitating a simpler separation of the Petroleum business.\n\nA Shareholder Circular and a Prospectus are expected to be published on or around 8 December 2021, which will contain further information on unification and the Limited shares, including details of the proposed UK scheme of arrangement to effect unification, an independent expert’s report on whether unification is in the best interests of BHP shareholders, and the notices of shareholder meetings of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc, which are expected to take place on 20 January 2022.\n\nUnification is expected to complete by 31 January 2022 subject to approval by the shareholders of both BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc, receipt of remaining regulatory approvals and UK Court sanction of the scheme.\n\n  BHP Chair, Ken MacKenzie:\n\n“BHP is in great shape and now is the right time to make strategic, transformative changes for the future. Unification will create one parent company, one share register and one share price globally. We believe this is the best structure for BHP to provide the resources the world needs and create long-term shareholder value.”\n\nBHP CEO, Mike Henry:\n\n“A unified corporate structure will make BHP simpler and more agile, with the strategic flexibility required to shape our portfolio to deliver value through producing the commodities needed for continued economic growth, improved living standards, electrification and decarbonisation.\"\n\n“We will retain listings in the UK, US, South Africa and Australia, providing BHP with continued access to global markets\n\n and giving shareholders the opportunity to benefit from our portfolio, management and operating performance for long- term value.”\n\n Background to unification\n\nBHP currently operates under a dual-listed company (DLC) corporate structure which was established at the time of the BHP and Billiton merger in 2001. The DLC structure comprises two parent companies - BHP Group Limited (Limited) in Australia and BHP Group Plc (Plc) in the United Kingdom - with separate stock exchange listings and separate share registers. The two groups operate as a unified economic entity with a common board and management, and shares in Limited and Plc carry equivalent voting and economic rights.\n\nFollowing a review of the DLC structure, on 17 August 2021 BHP announced its intention to unify its corporate structure. With changes over recent years to the BHP portfolio, a significant reduction in the earnings contribution from Plc assets and a material reduction in the expected costs of unification, the BHP Directors have decided unanimously that now is the right time to unify the corporate structure.\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nTo effect unification, Plc shareholders' shares (and ADSs1) will be exchanged for Limited shares on a one-for-one basis, resulting in Limited becoming the sole parent company of the BHP Group. There will be no change to the respective shareholdings of each Limited shareholder nor to the proportionate interest of each shareholder in the unified BHP Group.\n\nBHP will have its primary listing on the ASX, a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), and a sponsored Level II American Depositary Receipt program on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Our global investor base will continue to be able to invest in BHP on the same securities exchanges as prior to unification.\n\nDiagrams of the existing DLC structure and BHP’s proposed structure following unification are set out in the attachment to this release.\n\nUnification will not change BHP’s fundamentals: it will not change BHP’s underlying assets or operations, Board composition, Executive Leadership Team, corporate presence or cash flow generation. Importantly, there will also be no change to BHP’s dividend policy, including its ability to pay franked dividends, as a result of unification.\n\nAdvantages of unification\n\nThe Board considers the key advantages of unification to include:\n\nSimplification\n\nUnification would eliminate the inefficiencies and complexities of the DLC structure and would be a further step towards a simpler, leaner, more agile and more efficient BHP.\n\nStrategic flexibility\n\nA unified structure would improve agility and competitiveness for portfolio reshaping to maximise shareholder value over the long-term, including increasing its exposure to future facing commodities.\n\nUnification would enable BHP to undertake certain transactions more simply and efficiently than it can under the DLC structure. This includes, for example, the agreement to merge BHP’s Petroleum business with Woodside Petroleum Ltd as announced on 22 November 2021, which would be simpler to execute under a unified structure. Future demergers and equity raising transactions would also be simpler to execute following unification, with BHP having a single set of shareholders and only Limited shares on issue.\n\nElimination of the DLC dividend arrangements\n\nPlc’s earnings have reduced over time relative to Limited’s earnings due to the divestment of assets previously held by Plc and changes in commodity prices. In recent years, it has been necessary for Limited to pay significant dividends to Plc (and associated franking credits) to ensure that all BHP shareholders received equivalent dividends. Plc cannot use the franking credits, nor can it distribute them to its shareholders.\n\nFollowing unification, Limited would be the sole parent company of the BHP Group and the DLC dividend arrangements would be abolished. All dividends paid by Limited would be paid directly to shareholders of Limited, including former shareholders of Plc who receive shares in Limited pursuant to unification. Franking credits which would have been transferred to and consumed by Plc on DLC dividend arrangements would instead be distributed on dividends to the larger Limited shareholder base post-unification.\n\nElimination of the share price differential, creating a single global share price\n\nFollowing unification, BHP shares traded on the ASX, LSE and JSE would be interchangeable. As a result there are not expected to be any material differences in the respective share prices on each exchange (when adjusted for currency differences). Plc shares have historically traded at a lower price than Limited shares.\n\nImplementation\n\nUnification will require approval by a vote of the shareholders of each of Plc and Limited.2 As unification will involve a UK scheme of arrangement, it will also require the UK Court’s sanction of the scheme.\n\n1 American Depositary Shares\n\n2 The required shareholder resolutions for Plc will include resolutions relating to the Plc scheme of arrangement, amendment of Plc’s articles of association, the buy-back of the Plc special voting share and the conversion of Plc into a private company. The required resolutions for Limited will include resolutions relating to amendment of Limited’s constitution, the buy-back of the Limited special voting share, the DLC dividend share and the Plc special voting share and the conversion of Plc into a private company.\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nImplementation of unification also remains subject to approval of the National Treasury of South Africa and an outstanding competition regulatory clearance, both of which are intended to be obtained before the shareholder meetings, and receipt of final approvals in respect of the admission of Limited’s shares to the standard segment of the FCA Official List and trading on the LSE and the listing of Limited’s shares on the JSE.\n\nA general meeting of Limited is expected to take place on the afternoon of 20 January 2022 (Melbourne time). A scheme meeting and a general meeting of Plc are expected to take place in London on the morning of 20 January 2022 (UK time). These dates are subject to, amongst other things, the UK Court approving the convening of the Plc scheme meeting. Further information on these meetings will be set out in the Shareholder Circular.\n\nIf approved and all other conditions are satisfied or waived, unification is expected to complete on 31 January 2022 (Melbourne time), meaning that the expected last day of trading in Plc shares (including Plc shares in the form of ADSs on the NYSE) would be 28 January 2022 (in the relevant jurisdictions), and Limited shares will be admitted to trading on the ASX, LSE, JSE and Limited ADSs on the NYSE on 31 January 2022. On or before 31 January 2022, certain key steps will be taken to terminate the DLC structure, including cancellation of the Plc preference shares, the re-registration of Plc as a private limited company, and the termination of the DLC Sharing Agreement.\n\nExisting Plc shareholders who hold Plc shares:\n\n• on the UK register, would generally receive Limited shares in the form of depository interests that can be traded on the LSE;\n\n• on the South African register, would generally have their Central Securities Depositary Participant (CSDP) or broker’s account credited with a beneficial entitlement to Limited shares which can be traded on the JSE;\n\n• in the form of Plc ADSs, would generally receive Limited shares in the form of Limited ADSs that can be traded on the NYSE.\n\nCertain non-CREST Plc shareholders will have the opportunity to participate in a sale facility under which the Limited shares they would otherwise receive will be sold and they will receive the proceeds of sale.\n\nIn addition, a unified Limited does not satisfy the nationality requirements for inclusion in the FTSE UK Index Series and certain other European indices post-unification. This may result in certain Plc shareholders who actively or passively track these indices choosing not to, or being unable to, hold Limited shares following unification.\n\nLimited’s weighting in S&P/ASX indices is expected to increase as a result of the additional number of Limited shares on issue and the greater market capitalisation of Limited post-unification. This is likely to result in increased demand for, and buying of, Limited shares from institutional investors who actively or passively seek to track these indices.\n\nThe total transaction costs relating to unification are currently estimated to be between US$350 million and US$450 million (pre-tax) and comprise stamp duties and adviser and other fees.\n\nFurther information and documents\n\nFurther information regarding unification, including a detailed timetable and more information on the advantages, disadvantages and risks associated with unification, will be provided to BHP shareholders in a Shareholder Circular which is expected to be published on or around 8 December 2021, subject to receipt of the UK Court’s permission to convene the Plc scheme meeting and formal approval of the Prospectus by the FCA. The Shareholder Circular will include, as is customary in Australia, an independent expert’s report on whether unification is in the best interests of BHP shareholders. Additionally, a Prospectus is expected to be published at the same time as the Shareholder Circular, subject to receipt of formal approval of the Prospectus by the FCA.\n\nThe Shareholder Circular and Prospectus will be available on the BHP website (bhp.com/unify).\n\nShareholders of Limited and Plc are encouraged to read the Shareholder Circular (and Prospectus for shareholders of Plc) once these become available because they will contain important information in relation to unification and the shares in Limited to be issued in connection with unification.\n\nFurther information on BHP can be found at: www.bhp.com.\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\nBHP makes no representation or warranty as to the appropriateness, accuracy, completeness or reliability of the information in this release.\n\nThis release is for information purposes only and is not intended to and does not constitute or form part of any offer to sell or subscribe for or any invitation to purchase or subscribe for or otherwise acquire or dispose of any BHP securities or the solicitation of any vote or approval in any jurisdiction pursuant to unification or otherwise, nor will there be any sale, issuance or transfer of any BHP securities pursuant to unification or otherwise in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law. This release does not constitute a prospectus or prospectus equivalent document.\n\nPrior to making any decision in relation to unification or as to whether to invest in the shares in Limited, investors should read the Shareholder Circular and the Prospectus in their entirety, including the information incorporated by reference. Investors must rely upon their own examination, analysis and enquiries of BHP and the terms of the Shareholder Circular and Prospectus, including the merits and risks involved.\n\nForward looking statements\n\nThis release contains forward looking statements, including statements regarding: plans, strategies and objectives of management; approval of certain projects and consummation of certain transactions; unification, including, but not limited to, the perceived benefits of unification and expectations around the financial impact of unification on the BHP Group; future performance and future opportunities.

Woodside’s and BHP Petroleum’s customers for LNG, LPG, condensate and oil are either offshore or in areas where Woodside and BHP Petroleum do not overlap.\n\n“We found that post acquisition, Woodside would continue to face competition from a range of suppliers of domestic gas, including major producers Chevron and Santos, and from several other smaller suppliers including Shell and ExxonMobil. Woodside’s share of domestic gas after the acquisition will be approximately 20 per cent,” Mr Sims said.\n\n“In Western Australia, gas exporters are required to reserve the equivalent of 15 per cent of their export production for the domestic market, ensuring that domestic gas will continue to be available from Woodside and BHP Petroleum’s export assets, and from a range of other competitors,” Mr Sims said.\n\nThe ACCC also considered that Woodside would be unlikely to have an incentive to reduce supply of natural gas from BHP Petroleum’s majority-owned, domestic-only site at Macedon, given gas from Macedon can only be supplied to the Western Australian domestic market. In addition, the number of competing suppliers in that market are also likely to constrain Woodside from decreasing gas supply.\n\nThe ACCC consulted the relevant Western Australia Government department, the WA Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation, which did not express concerns about the proposed acquisition.\n\nFurther information is available at Woodside Petroleum Ltd - BHP Petroleum International Pty Ltd.\n\nBackground\n\nWoodside is an ASX listed oil and gas exploration and production company which holds interests in gas projects in Western Australia including the North West Shelf, Wheatstone, Pluto and Scarborough, and other global interests.\n\nBHP Petroleum holds interests in gas projects in Western Australia including the North West Shelf, Macedon and Scarborough, as well as in the Bass Strait and globally. Its parent company, BHP, extracts and processes minerals, oil and gas, primarily in Australia and the Americas.\n\n   For personal use only\n\n\n\nMedia enquiries: 1300 138 917 Email: media@accc.gov.au accc.gov.au/media\n\n For personal use only\n\n",

Full year total copper production is trending towards the low end of the guidance range, reflecting lower production guidance for Pampa Norte. Metallurgical coal guidance has been reduced as a result of significant wet weather impacts and COVID-19 related labour constraints.\n\n Full year unit cost guidance(1) for WAIO, Escondida and NSWEC remains unchanged. Unit cost guidance for Queensland Coal has been increased, reflecting lower expected volumes for the full year.\n\n Progress on the review of our lower grade metallurgical coal and thermal coal assets continues. The Cerrejón divestment to Glencore completed in January 2022 and the announced share sale agreement to divest BHP Mitsui Coal (BMC) is expected to complete in the middle of the 2022 calendar year.\n\n Our potash major projects under development are tracking to plan. The Jansen shaft project is 98% complete and the Jansen Stage 1 project has commenced contract awards.\n\n BHP announced a final decision to unify BHP’s corporate structure under its existing Australian parent company, BHP Group Limited. Shareholder meetings to vote on unification will be held on 20 January 2022. Subject to shareholder approval and UK Court sanction, unification is expected to complete by 31 January 2022.\n\n Completion of the proposed merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside is expected in the June 2022 quarter subject to satisfaction of conditions precedent including approval by Woodside shareholders. The half year financial results are being prepared on the basis that the Petroleum business is a discontinued operation and restated financial information for the year ended 30 June 2021 and the half year ended 31 December 2020 is provided in Attachment 1.\n\n     Production Dec H21 Dec Q21 (vs Dec H20) (vs Sep Q21)\n\n     Dec Q21 vs Sep Q21 commentary\n\n Copper (kt) Iron ore (Mt)\n\nMetallurgical coal (Mt)(2)\n\nEnergy coal (Mt)(3)\n\nNickel (kt)\n\nDiscontinued operations\n\nPetroleum (MMboe)\n\n742.0 365.5 Lower volumes at Olympic Dam due to the planned smelter maintenance campaign, (12%) (3%) completed in January 2022. This was partially offset by higher volumes at Antamina.\n\n129.4 66.1 Higher volumes reflecting strong supply chain performance, increased ore car 1% 4% availability and the continued ramp up of South Flank. This was partially offset by the impact of temporary rail labour shortages due to COVID-19 related border restrictions.\n\n17.7 8.8 Volumes flat due to double the amount of rainfall recorded in this quarter impacting (8%) 0% most operations and planned maintenance in the previous quarter.\n\n7.2 3.0 Lower volumes due to three times the amount of rainfall in this quarter impacting 5% (30%) stripping and mine productivity, partially offset by mining in lower strip ratio areas.\n\n39.3 21.5 Higher volumes due to planned maintenance across the supply chain in the previous (15%) 21% quarter.\n\n53.2 25.7 Lower volumes due to reduced seasonal gas demand at Bass Strait. This was partially 5% (7%) offset by a Shenzi infill well brought online and higher production at North West Shelf.\n\n                          Group copper equivalent production decreased by 4%(4) in the December 2021 half year largely due to lower copper and metallurgical coal volumes.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the half year ended 31 December 2021 1\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Summary\n\n   BHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry:\n\n“BHP was fatality free at our operated assets for the third consecutive year. Our continuing focus on people and on operational reliability enabled us to achieve near record production in iron ore and to reduce the impacts of adverse weather and COVID-19 related labour constraints in our operations. Cost control remained strong across the business, in the face of a more inflationary environment. Unit cost guidance remains intact bar a change to metallurgical coal which is a function of the lowering of production guidance as a result of significant wet weather and in anticipation of Omicron headwinds in the early part of the second half of the financial year.\n\nWe completed major planned maintenance programs in our Iron Ore, Nickel West and Olympic Dam assets. In Nickel West, we achieved first saleable production of nickel sulphate crystals from the Kwinana plant, an exciting new addition to our product suite that will further enhance our offering into the battery electric vehicle market. The ramp-up of South Flank continues to progress well. The Spence Growth project is realising lower than expected recoveries and we are\n\n studying plant design modifications in order to lift recoveries to planned levels.\n\nWe continued to progress a number of actions related to our portfolio and corporate structure. We progressed the merger of our petroleum assets with Woodside and prepared for a shareholder vote on a unified corporate structure. We advanced the Jansen potash project and announced a share sale agreement of our interest in the BHP Mitsui Coal metallurgical coal joint venture. We bolstered options in future facing commodities investing in prospective copper assets in the Northern Territory and South Australia and we secured an early stage entry into a world-scale nickel sulphide resource in Tanzania.\n\nOverall we made good progress in positioning our portfolio and performance to deliver returns for shareholders now and into the future.”\n\n Operational performance\n\nProduction and guidance are summarised below.\n\nNote: All guidance is subject to further potential impacts from COVID-19 during the 2022 financial year.\n\n       Dec Dec Production H21 Q21\n\nDec H21 vs Dec H20\n\n(12%) (15%) 40% (56%) 1% 1% (1%) 0% >100% (8%) (10%) 5% >100% (15%)\n\n5%\n\nDec Q21 vs Dec Q20\n\n(15%) (15%) 26% (70%) (1%) 6% 4% 5% >100% (7%) (11%) (8%) >100% (10%)\n\n8%\n\nDec Q21 vs Sep Q21\n\n(3%) 0% 1% (52%) 7% 4% 5% 5% (2%) 0% (3%) (30%) 6% 21%\n\n(7%)\n\nPrevious FY22 guidance\n\n1,590 – 1,760 1,000 – 1,080 330 – 370 140 – 170 120 – 140 249 – 259 246 – 255 278 – 288 3–4 39–44 70–78 13–15 n/a 85–95\n\n99–106\n\nCurrent FY22 guidance\n\n1,590 – 1,760 1,020 – 1,080 260 – 300 140 – 150 120 – 140 249 – 259 246 – 255 278 – 288 3–4 38–41 68–72 13–15 n/a 85–95\n\nn/a\n\n       Copper (kt) Escondida (kt) Pampa Norte (kt) Olympic Dam (kt) Antamina (kt)\n\nIron ore (Mt)\n\nWAIO (Mt)\n\nWAIO (100% basis) (Mt) Samarco (Mt)\n\nMetallurgical coal (Mt)(i)\n\nQueensland Coal (100% basis) (Mt)\n\nEnergy coal – NSWEC (Mt) Energy coal – Cerrejón (Mt)(ii) Nickel (kt)\n\nDiscontinued operations Petroleum (MMboe)(iii)\n\n742.0 365.5 488.3 244.6 135.8 68.3\n\n43.7 14.2\n\n74.2 38.4 129.4 66.1 127.3 65.1 144.4 73.9\n\n2.1 1.0 17.7 8.8 30.7 15.1\n\n7.2 3.0\n\n4.2 2.2 39.3 21.5\n\n53.2 25.7\n\nLow end Narrowed range Lowered Narrowed range Unchanged\n\nUnchanged Unchanged Unchanged\n\nLowered Unchanged\n\nUnchanged\n\n                                                                        (i) We announced the share sale agreement to divest our interest BMC as part of Queensland Coal.

However, until merger completion, we expect a production run rate broadly consistent with the original FY22 production guidance of between 99 and 106 MMboe.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the half year ended 31 December 2021 2\n\n2021, however will continue to report\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nSummary of disclosures\n\nBHP expects its December 2021 half year financial results to reflect certain items as summarised in the table below. The table does not provide a comprehensive list of all items impacting the period. The financial statements are the subject of ongoing work that will not be finalised until the release of the financial results on 15 February 2022. Accordingly the information in the table below contains preliminary information that is subject to update and finalisation.\n\n   H1 FY22 impact Description US$M(i)\n\nClassification(ii)\n\nOperating costs\n\n↑ Operating costs\n\nExploration expense\n\n↑ Depreciation, amortisation and impairments\n\nTaxation expense\n\n↓ Operating cash inflow\n\n↑ Operating cash inflow ↑ Financing cash outflow ↑ Exceptional item charge\n\n↑ Exceptional item charge\n\n   Unit costs for WAIO, Escondida and NSWEC are expected to be in line with full year guidance (at guidance exchange rates), with WAIO tracking towards the bottom end of guidance\n\nNote: weaker Australian dollar and Chilean peso than guidance rates in the period(iii)\n\nUnit cost guidance for Queensland Coal has been increased to between US$85 and US$94 per tonne (at guidance exchange rates), reflecting lower expected volumes for the full year\n\nExploration expense (minerals exploration programs)\n\nHigher depreciation and amortisation mainly at WAIO following South Flank commissioning and prior period update of closure provision at Yandi.\n\nThe Group’s adjusted effective tax rate for H1 FY22 is expected to be slightly below the full year guidance range of 32 to 37 per cent given Petroleum will be presented as a discontinued operation. An updated guidance range will be provided in the half year financial results\n\nWorking capital movements relating to royalties, inventory builds, net price impacts on receivables and other movements.\n\nDividends received from Cerrejón Dividends paid to non-controlling interests\n\nImpairment of US deferred tax assets no longer expected to be recoverable after the Petroleum merger (after tax)\n\nFinancial impact on BHP Brasil of the Samarco dam failure\n\n-\n\n-\n\n80 425 – 475\n\n-\n\n2,000 – 2,500\n\n~240(iv)\n\n~1,250 400 – 450\n\nRefer footnote(v)\n\n                             (i) Numbers are not tax effected, unless otherwise noted.\n\n(ii) There will be a corresponding balance sheet, cash flow and/or income statement impact as relevant, unless otherwise noted.\n\n(iii) Average exchange rates for H1 FY22 of AUD/USD 0.73 (guidance rate AUD/USD 0.78) and USD/CLP 798 (guidance rate USD/CLP 727).\n\n(iv) There will be no net income statement impact in relation to Cerrejón for H1 FY22. While the dividends received will be recognised as other income, the associated adjustment to the proceeds to be received on sale completion results in an offsetting expense to reflect the reduction in the carrying value of the Cerrejón assets held for sale.\n\n(v) Financial impact is the subject of ongoing work and is not yet finalised. See corporate update section for further information on Samarco.\n\nThe December 2021 half year financial results are being prepared on the basis that BHP Petroleum will be reported as a discontinued operation. BHP Petroleum will be excluded from the consolidated Income Statement and will not be included when calculating the minimum dividend payout. BMC will continue to be consolidated with Queensland Coal as a continuing operation until the expected completion in the middle of the 2022 calendar year. On the Balance Sheet, both BMC and BHP Petroleum will be reclassified as assets held for sale and excluded from net operating assets.\n\nMajor development projects\n\nAt the end of December 2021, BHP had two major projects under development, the US$2.97 billion Jansen mine shafts project and the US$5.7 billion Jansen Stage 1 project.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the half year ended 31 December 2021 3\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n   Average realised prices\n\nThe average realised prices achieved for our major commodities are summarised below.\n\n               Average realised prices(i)\n\nDec H21 Dec H20 Jun H21 FY21\n\nDec H21 vs Dec H20\n\nDec H21 vs Jun H21\n\nDec H21 vs FY21\n\n         Copper (US$/lb)\n\n  Iron ore (US$/wmt, FOB)\n\n           Metallurgical coal (US$/t) 259.71\n\n97.61 114.81 106.64 166% 126%\n\n144%\n\n           Hard coking coal (US$/t)(ii) 278.60\n\n106.30 118.54 112.72 162% 135%\n\n147%\n\n           Weak coking coal (US$/t)(ii) 218.65\n\n73.17 104.40 89.62 199% 109%\n\n144%\n\n           Thermal coal (US$/t)(iii) 137.68\n\n44.35 70.83 58.42 210% 94%\n\n136%\n\n          Nickel metal (US$/t)   19,651\n\n15,140 17,537 16,250 30% 12%\n\n21%\n\n         Discontinued operations\n\n  Oil (crude and condensate) (US$/bbl)\n\n  Natural gas (US$/Mscf)(iv)\n\n  LNG (US$/Mscf)\n\n 4.31 3.32 4.34 113.54 103.78 158.17\n\n74.26 41.40 63.05 5.80 3.83 4.86 15.10 4.45 7.04\n\n3.81 30% (1%) 13% 130.56 9% (28%) (13%)\n\n52.56 79% 18% 41% 4.34 51% 19% 34% 5.63 239% 114% 168%\n\n                             (i) Based on provisional, unaudited estimates. Prices exclude sales from equity accounted investments, third party product and internal sales, and represent the weighted average of various sales terms (for example: FOB, CIF and CFR), unless otherwise noted. Includes the impact of provisional pricing and finalisation adjustments.\n\n(ii) Hard coking coal (HCC) refers generally to those metallurgical coals with a Coke Strength after Reaction (CSR) of 35 and above, which includes coals across the spectrum from Premium Coking to Semi Hard Coking coals, while weak coking coal (WCC) refers generally to those metallurgical coals with a CSR below 35.\n\n(iii) Export sales only; excludes Cerrejón. Includes thermal coal sales from metallurgical coal mines.\n\n(iv) Includes internal sales.\n\nThe large majority of iron ore shipments were linked to index pricing for the month of shipment, with price differentials predominantly a reflection of market fundamentals and product quality. Iron ore sales were based on an average moisture rate of 7.2 per cent. The large majority of metallurgical coal and energy coal exports were linked to index pricing for the month of shipment or sold on the spot market at fixed or index-linked prices, with price differentials reflecting product quality. The majority of copper cathodes sales were linked to index pricing for quotation periods one month after the month of shipment, and three to four months after the month of shipment for copper concentrates sales with price differentials applied for location and treatment costs. The large majority of oil sales were linked to West Texas intermediate (WTI) or Brent based indices, with differentials applied for quality, locational and transportation costs.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group had 333 kt of outstanding copper sales that were revalued at a weighted average price of US$4.42 per pound. The final price of these sales will be determined over the remainder of the 2022 financial year. In addition, 323 kt of copper sales from the 2021 financial year were subject to a finalisation adjustment in the current period. The provisional pricing and finalisation adjustments will increase Underlying EBITDA(5) by US$11 million in the December 2021 half year and are included in the average realised copper price in the above table.\n\nCorporate update\n\nPortfolio\n\nIn November 2021, BHP announced it had signed a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement with Stanmore Resources Limited to divest its 80 per cent interest in BHP Mitsui Coal Pty Ltd (BMC), an operated metallurgical coal joint venture in Queensland. The purchase price comprises US$1.1 billion cash on completion, US$100 million in cash six months after completion and the potential for up to US$150 million in a price-linked earn-out payable in the 2024 calendar year. Completion is expected in the middle of the 2022 calendar year subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including customary competition and regulatory conditions.\n\nIn November 2021, BHP signed a binding Share Sale Agreement for the merger of BHP’s oil and gas portfolio with Woodside to create a global top 10 independent energy company by production. It is proposed that Woodside will acquire BHP Petroleum in exchange for new Woodside shares. Completion of the merger is subject to satisfaction of conditions precedent including regulatory and competition authority approvals and approval by Woodside’s shareholders. The process remains on track and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission provided informal clearance of the merger in December 2021. The Woodside shareholder meeting to vote on the merger as\n\nBHP Operational Review for the half year ended 31 December 2021 4\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nwell as completion of the merger is targeted for the June 2022 quarter. In addition to its primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange, Woodside is pursuing a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange and a listing of American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIn December 2021, BHP announced a final decision to unify BHP’s corporate structure under its existing Australian parent company, BHP Group Limited. The Board believes that unification is in the best interests of BHP shareholders. Unification will create a corporate structure that is simpler and more efficient, reduces duplication and streamlines BHP’s governance and internal processes. Shareholder meetings of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc will take place on 20 January 2022 to approve unification. Unification is expected to complete by 31 January 2022 subject to shareholder approval of both BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc and UK Court sanction of the scheme.\n\nIn December 2021, BHP announced it would not increase or extend its offer to acquire Noront Resources. BHP is committed to its strict capital discipline framework and while the Eagle’s Nest deposit is a promising resource, we do not see adequate long-term value for BHP shareholders to support an increase in BHP’s offer to match the proposal from Wyloo Metals Pty Ltd.\n\nIn December 2021, BHP advanced its early-stage nickel interests by agreeing to invest in the Kabanga Nickel Project (Kabanga), a high-quality nickel sulphide deposit in Tanzania. Kabanga is a joint venture between Kabanga Nickel Limited (84 per cent interest) and the Government of Tanzania (16 per cent). BHP has made an initial investment of US$40 million in Kabanga, which will convert into an 8.9 per cent equity stake in Kabanga Nickel Limited once approvals and conditions are met. The proceeds will be used to accelerate drilling and study work. Further investments, including a second tranche of US$50 million, have been agreed in principle subject to the parties agreeing definitive documentation and certain other conditions. In parallel, BHP has invested US$10 million in Lifezone Limited to progress its low-carbon hydrometallurgical processing technology.\n\nIn January 2022, BHP completed the sale to Glencore of its 33.3 per cent interest in the Cerrejón joint venture in Colombia. The transaction was first announced on 29 June 2021 for a total cash consideration of US$294 million.\n\nSamarco\n\nSamarco’s Judicial Reorganisation process is continuing in the Commercial Courts of Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais. The Judicial Reorganisation is a process for Samarco to restructure its financial debts in order to establish a sustainable independent financial position that would allow Samarco to continue its operations safely and meet its Renova Foundation obligations. BHP Brasil will continue to support Samarco in this process.\n\nNegotiations are ongoing with State and Federal Prosecutors and certain other Brazilian public authorities in relation to the review of the Framework Agreement. The Framework Agreement was entered into between Samarco, Vale and BHP Brasil and the relevant Brazilian authorities in March 2016 and established the Renova Foundation to develop and implement environmental and socio-economic programs to remediate and provide compensation for damage caused by the Samarco dam failure.\n\nIn October 2021, the 12th Federal Court delivered a ruling that expanded the scope of eligible individuals of the court mandated compensation process (“Novel System”), extended its geographical scope and increased indemnification amounts for certain categories of damage. The decision is under appeal and applications have been made to clarify certain aspects of the ruling. BHP is currently reviewing the impact of the 12th Federal Court’s decision on the Group’s provision for the Samarco dam failure and it is possible that the provision could materially increase.\n\nIn December 2021, BHP agreed to fund US$700 million in further financial support for the Renova Foundation, which will be offset against the Group’s provision for the Samarco dam failure. Further funding requirements for the period to 31 December 2022 continue to be assessed and, will be subject to future approval by BHP.\n\nWe will provide an update to the ongoing potential financial impacts on BHP Brasil of the Samarco dam failure with the release of the financial results on 15 February 2022. Any financial impacts will continue to be treated as an exceptional item.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the half year ended 31 December 2021 5\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Copper\n\n Production\n\nCopper (kt) Zinc (t) Uranium (t)\n\nDec H21\n\n742.0 62,892 818\n\nDec Q21\n\n365.5 29,603 287\n\nDec H21 vs Dec H20\n\n(12%) (18%) (55%)\n\nDec Q21 vs Dec Q20\n\n(15%) (29%) (70%)\n\nDec Q21 vs Sep Q21\n\n(3%) (11%) (46%)\n\n                          Copper – Total copper production decreased by 12 per cent to 742 kt. Full year production is trending towards the low end of the guidance range for the 2022 financial year, which reflects lower production guidance at Pampa Norte, and narrowed guidance ranges for Escondida and Olympic Dam. Volumes will be weighted to the second half of the financial year as expected.\n\nUncertainty around impacts from COVID-19 remains as the pandemic evolves, despite an improved operating environment for our Chilean assets in the December 2021 half year due to high COVID-19 vaccination rates and continued use of successful control measures at our operating sites.\n\nEscondida copper production decreased by 15 per cent to 488 kt due to concentrator feed grade decline despite a record performance for material mined. Guidance for the 2022 financial year has been narrowed to between 1,020 and 1,080 kt as concentrator feed grade is expected to improve in the June 2022 half year as the mine sequence moves towards higher grade areas. Concentrator feed grade decline remains forecasted at approximately two per cent for the 2022 financial year. Medium term guidance of an annual average of 1.2 Mt of copper production over the next five years remains unchanged, with production expected to be weighted towards the latter years.\n\nPampa Norte copper production increased by 40 per cent to 136 kt, reflecting the continued ramp up of the Spence Growth Option (SGO), partially offset by the impact of planned lower ore stacking grade, which is expected to decline by approximately 10 per cent for the 2022 financial year. SGO demonstrated full concentrator throughput of 95 ktpd in the December 2021 quarter. Guidance for the 2022 financial year has been reduced from between 330 and 370 kt to between 260 and 300 kt, as the result of a fatality at the third party desalination plant which impacted Spence operations, operational uncertainty related to Cerro Colorado water access and licencing, including water extraction, and lower than expected recoveries at SGO. Plant design modifications, including modifications to the rougher floatation circuit will be required to increase SGO recoveries to achieve planned copper production levels. The Spence guidance to average 300 ktpa (including cathodes) in the first four years of production will be subject to the timing of these modifications being completed.\n\nOlympic Dam copper production decreased by 56 per cent to 44 kt as a result of the major smelter maintenance campaign in the period. The maintenance campaign was completed in January 2022 and ramp up to full capacity is now expected by April 2022 (previously March 2022), due to COVID-19 impacts on the availability of workforce. The full scope of the maintenance campaign was delivered, including the rebuild of the flash furnace and its ancillary equipment and refurbishment of the acid plant, which has resulted in significant plant improvements. Guidance for the 2022 financial year has been narrowed to between 140 and 150 kt as production is trending towards the low end of the original guidance range.\n\nAntamina copper production increased by one per cent to 74 kt reflecting higher copper head grades and zinc production decreased by 18 per cent to 63kt reflecting lower zinc head grades. Guidance remains unchanged for the 2022 financial year, with copper production of between 120 and 140 kt, and zinc production of between 115 and 130 kt.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the half year ended 31 December 2021 6\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Iron Ore\n\n Production\n\nIron ore production (kt)\n\nDec H21\n\n129,401\n\nDec Q21\n\n66,102\n\nDec H21 vs Dec H20\n\n1%\n\nDec Q21 Dec Q21 vs vs Dec Q20 Sep Q21\n\n6% 4%\n\nthe 2022 financial year\n\n              Iron ore – Total iron ore production increased by one per cent to 129 Mt.

This reflects continued strong supply chain performance including higher car dumper performance and improved rail cycle times. South Flank ramp up to full production capacity of 80 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) over three years remains on track with a peak rate of 45 Mtpa achieved in the half year contributing to record lump sales. In December 2021, we approved the South Flank Autonomous Haulage Project to automate the current fleet of Komatsu haul trucks. The project is scheduled to commence in the June 2022 quarter and is expected to be completed within 18 months. The proposed easing of Western Australia’s border restrictions on 5 February 2022 may introduce some short-term disruption to the operating environment as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves in the state.\n\nSamarco production was 2.1 Mt (BHP share), following the recommencement of iron ore pellet production at one concentrator in December 2020.

The revision is a result of significant La Niña related wet weather impacts during the December 2021 quarter coupled with COVID-19 related labour constraints. Workforce absenteeism arising from the COVID-19 Omicron variant is anticipated to continue into the early part of the second half of the 2022 financial year.\n\nQueensland Coal production decreased due to significant wet weather, with double the amount of rainfall, coupled with COVID-19 related labour constraints impacting stripping and mine productivity across most operations. A longwall move was successfully executed at Broadmeadow and the Caval Ridge wash plant maintenance was also completed on time during the December 2021 quarter.\n\nFollowing the recent easing of Queensland’s border restrictions, COVID-19 related absenteeism has increased and remains a risk for the remainder of the year.\n\nEnergy coal – Energy coal production increased by five per cent to 7 Mt. Guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 13 and 15 Mt. The divestment of our interest in Cerrejón was completed in January 2022 and Cerrejón volumes are no longer included in energy coal guidance.\n\nNSWEC production increased as a result of increased stripping volumes enabled by continued truck productivity and mining in lower strip ratio areas, despite increased rainfall and COVID-19 related impacts. High quality products now make up approximately 80 per cent of sales compared to approximately 60 per cent of sales in the prior period.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the half year ended 31 December 2021 7\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Other\n\n Nickel production\n\nNickel (kt)\n\nDec H21 Dec Q21\n\n39.3 21.5\n\nDec H21 Dec Q21 Dec Q21 vs vs vs Dec H20 Dec Q20 Sep Q21\n\n(15%) (10%) 21%\n\n             Nickel – Nickel West production decreased by 15 per cent to 39 kt, reflecting planned maintenance at the Kalgoorlie Smelter, Kwinana Refinery and the Leinster and Kambalda concentrators in the September 2021 quarter, and planned asset integrity work to support operational stability completed in the December 2021 quarter. Guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 85 and 95 kt, with volumes weighted towards the second half of the financial year.

Greenfield minerals exploration is being undertaken on advancing copper targets in Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Canada, Australia and the south-west United States. Nickel targets are also being advanced in Canada and Australia. Specifically in copper, we are undertaking target drilling in Chile, Ecuador and the United States while further drilling is underway in Australia.\n\nIn October 2021, BHP executed its farm-in agreement for the early-stage prospective Elliott copper project covering 7,200 km2 in the Northern Territory, Australia. Under the terms of the agreement, BHP can earn up to 75 per cent interest in Elliott by spending up to A$25 million over 10 years.\n\nAlso in October 2021, BHP exercised its option to form an exploration joint venture with Red Tiger Resources for the Intercept Hill copper project, which borders Oak Dam in South Australia.\n\nAt Oak Dam in South Australia, BHP is continuing next stage resource definition drilling, after commencing the program in May 2021.\n\nIn December 2021, BHP advanced its early-stage nickel interests by investing in the Kabanga Nickel Project (Kabanga), a high-quality nickel sulphide deposit in Tanzania. Kabanga is a joint venture between Kabanga Nickel Limited (84 per cent interest) and the Government of Tanzania (16 per cent).\n\nBHP Operational Review for the half year ended 31 December 2021 8\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Discontinued operations - Petroleum\n\n Production\n\nCrude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (MMboe) Natural gas (bcf)\n\nTotal petroleum production (MMboe)\n\nDec H21 Dec Q21\n\n25.1 12.3 168.5 80.1 53.2 25.7\n\nDec H21 vs Dec H20\n\n13% (1%) 5%\n\nDec Q21 vs Dec Q20\n\n15% 2% 8%\n\nDec Q21 vs Sep Q21\n\n(3%) (9%) (7%)\n\n                         BHP announced on 22 November 2021 a binding share sale agreement for the proposed merger of BHP’s oil and gas portfolio with Woodside. Completion of the merger is expected in the June 2022 quarter subject to satisfaction of conditions precedent including approval by Woodside shareholders. The effective date of the merger is 1 July 2021. The half year financial results are being prepared on the basis that BHP Petroleum is a discontinued operation.\n\nTotal petroleum production increased by 5 per cent to 53 MMboe. No further guidance for the 2022 financial year will be provided for Petroleum given the business will be presented as a discontinued operation. However, until merger completion, we expect a production run rate broadly consistent with the original 2022 financial year production guidance of between 99 and 106 MMboe.\n\nCrude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production increased by 13 per cent to 25 MMboe, reflecting the additional 28 percent working interest acquired in Shenzi in November 2020, increased volumes from Ruby following first production in May 2021, and lower impact from weather events in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by natural field decline across the portfolio.\n\nNatural gas production decreased by one per cent to 169 bcf, reflecting decreased production at North West Shelf and natural field decline across the portfolio, partially offset by increased volumes from Ruby and higher seasonal demand for gas at Bass Strait.\n\nProjects\n\nProject and Capital ownership expenditure US$M\n\nInitial production target date\n\nMid-CY22 CY24\n\nCY26\n\nCapacity\n\nNew floating production facility with the capacity to produce up to 140,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n\nA two-well subsea tie-in to the Shenzi platform, with the capacity to produce up to 30,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n\nNew upstream facilities designed to deliver daily gas quantities to manufacture 8 Mtpa LNG and 180 TJ/day of domestic gas.\n\nProgress\n\nOn schedule and budget.\n\nThe overall project is 97% complete.\n\nOn schedule and budget.\n\nThe overall project is 5% complete.\n\nSanctioned in November 2021.\n\nOn schedule and budget.\n\nThe overall project is 10% complete.\n\n          Mad Dog Phase 2 (US Gulf of Mexico) 23.9% (non-operator)\n\nShenzi North development\n\n(US Gulf of Mexico) 72% (operator)\n\n2,154 392\n\n          Scarborough 1,500 (Western Australia)\n\n26.5% (non-operator)\n\n  On 22 November 2021, we announced the approval of US$1.5 billion in capital expenditure for development of the\n\n Scarborough upstream project located in the North Carnarvon Basin, Western Australia. The approved capital\n\n expenditure represents BHP’s 26.5 per cent participating interest in Phase 1 of the upstream development. Final\n\n investment decisions have also been made by Woodside and the Scarborough Joint Venture.\n\nIn the December 2021 quarter, we completed the Ruby project in Trinidad & Tobago. The project was completed on schedule and within budget, and the Ruby field is currently producing both oil and gas.\n\nThe Mad Dog Phase 2 project’s semi-submersible platform, Argos, was towed to final location in the US Gulf of Mexico and moored. Offshore execution of construction and commissioning is in progress. First production from Mad Dog Phase 2 is expected from mid-calendar year 2022.\n\nIn December 2021, we reached a commercial milestone with the Trion project in Mexico with the filing of a Declaration of Commerciality with the National Hydrocarbons Commission. As announced in August 2021, we have moved Trion into the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) phase and work is progressing to plan. Studies are underway, focused on completion of the engineering, commercial arrangements and execution planning required to progress readiness for a Final Investment Decision from mid-calendar year 2022.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the half year ended 31 December 2021 9\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nPetroleum exploration\n\nExploration and appraisal wells drilled during the December 2021 quarter are summarised below.\n\n        Well\n\nBongos-3X\n\nBongos-3X ST01\n\nBongos-4 Wasabi-1 Wasabi-2\n\nLocation\n\nTarget Formation age\n\nBHP equity\n\n70% (BHP Operator) 70% (BHP Operator) 70% (BHP Operator) 75% (BHP Operator) 75% (BHP Operator)\n\nSpud date\n\n27 July 2021\n\n27 July 2021\n\n6 August 2021\n\n7 October 2021\n\n17 November 2021\n\nWater depth\n\n2,114 m 2,114 m 2,177 m 764 m 764 m\n\nTotal well depth\n\n5,174 m 5,169 m 5,163 m 2,673 m 6,895 m\n\nStatus\n\nHydrocarbons encountered\n\nHydrocarbons encountered\n\nHydrocarbons encountered\n\nPlugged and abandoned\n\nDrilling ahead(i)\n\n        Trinidad & Tobago Gas Block TTDAA 14\n\nTrinidad & Tobago Gas Block TTDAA 14\n\nTrinidad & Tobago Gas Block TTDAA 14\n\nGulf of Mexico Oil GC124\n\nGulf of Mexico Oil GC124\n\nLate Miocene Late Miocene Late Miocene Early Miocene Early Miocene\n\n                                  (i) Well depth and status as at 31 December 2021.\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, the Calypso appraisal drilling programme concluded on 20 December 2021. All wells encountered hydrocarbons. Bongos-3 confirmed volumes downdip of prior penetrations and Bongos-4 established volumes in a new segment. The well results are currently under evaluation and will be incorporated into the development plan.\n\nIn the central Gulf of Mexico, the Wasabi-1 well encountered a mechanical difficulty and was plugged and abandoned on 13 November 2021. Wasabi-2 (GC124-002) was spud on 17 November 2021 and drilling operations continue.\n\nIn Barbados, a 3D seismic survey was acquired in November 2021 over a portion of the Bimshire and Carlisle Bay blocks(6). Processed data is expected to be delivered in mid-calendar year 2022.\n\nBHP has acquired interests in offshore exploration blocks in the Red Sea in Egypt. In December 2021, the Minister of Energy in Egypt signed the Deed of Assignment for Red Sea Block 1, finalising the assignment of a 45 per cent participating interest from Chevron to BHP. The effective date of the transfer is 12 September 2021. This follows a separate agreement with Shell in March 2021 for BHP to acquire a 30 and 25 per cent non-operated working interest in Egypt’s Red Sea Blocks 3 and 4, respectively. The effective date of BHP’s participation in Blocks 3 and 4 is pending final government approvals.\n\nPetroleum exploration expenditure for the December 2021 half year was US$243 million, of which US$112 million was expensed. An approximately US$540 million exploration and appraisal program is being executed for the 2022 financial year.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the half year ended 31 December 2021 10\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nVariance analysis relates to the relative performance of BHP and/or its operations during the December 2021 half year compared with the December 2020 half year, unless otherwise noted.

The merger, which has an effective date of 1 July 2021, is subject to satisfaction of conditions precedent by 30 June 2022 or an agreed later date including shareholder, regulatory and other approvals.\n\nPrior to completion, the Group will carry on its Petroleum business in the normal course and, while the effective date at which the right to net cash flows transferred to Woodside was 1 July 2021, the Group continues to control its Petroleum assets until the completion date of the transaction.\n\nAs such, the Group will continue to recognise its share of revenue, expenses, net finance costs and associated income tax expense related to the operation until the completion date. However, as at 31 December 2021, the Petroleum business will be classified as a disposal group held for sale and as a discontinued operation.\n\nThe nature of each change reflected in the attached restated financial information is as follows:\n\nAll income and expense items relating to the Petroleum Discontinued Operation have been removed from the individual line items in the Consolidated Income Statement. The post-tax loss of the Petroleum Discontinued Operation is presented as a single amount in the line item titled “Loss after taxation from Discontinued operations”; and\n\nAll cash flows and other items relating to the Petroleum Discontinued Operation have been removed from the individual line items in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement. The net cash flows attributable to the operating, investing and financing activities of the Petroleum Discontinued Operation are each disclosed in single amounts in each section of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for these periods are not required to be

The APMs and below reconciliations included in this document for the restated half year ended 31 December 2020 and year ended 30 June 2021 periods are unaudited. The APMs are consistent with how management review financial performance of the Group with the Board and the investment community.\n\nThe definitions and calculation methodology to compute the Group’s APMs have not changed as a result of the proposed Merger. For further information and a list of the “Definition and calculation of alternative performance measures” refer to the Group’s 2021 published Annual report.\n\nComparative periods have been adjusted for the effects of applying IFRS 5/AASB 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’.\n\nThe following tables provide reconciliations between the APMs and their nearest respective IFRS measure. As the Group’s balance sheet is not required to be restated under IFRS 5/AASB 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, certain APMs such as Net Debt Waterfall, Net debt and gearing ratio and Underlying ROCE have not been restated and are presented consistently as previously published in respective comparable period financial information.\n\nExceptional items\n\nTo improve the comparability of underlying financial performance between reporting periods some of our APMs adjust the relevant IFRS measures for exceptional items.\n\nExceptional items are those gains or losses where their nature, including the expected frequency of the events giving rise to them, and impact is considered material to the Group’s Financial Statements.

Underlying EBITDA(i) of US$18.5 billion at a margin(i) of 64% for continuing operations. Disciplined cost performance, with unit cost guidance reiterated (at guidance exchange rates(ii)) with the exception of Queensland Coal which has increased, reflecting lower expected volumes for the full year as a result of significant wet weather and labour constraints.\n\n• Attributable profit of US$9.4 billion and Underlying attributable profit(i) of US$10.7 billion up 77% from the prior period for total operations.\n\n Net operating cash flow of US$11.5 billion and free cash flow(i) of US$8.5 billion for continuing operations reflects higher realised prices across our major commodities and reliable operational performance.\n\nDisciplined capital allocation and a revised net debt target to between US$5 and US$15 billion\n\n Capital and exploration expenditure(i) of US$2.9 billion for continuing operations. Guidance for minerals capital and exploration expenditure for the full year has decreased by US$0.2 billion to US$6.5 billion as a result of favourable exchange rate movements.\n\n Our potash developments are tracking to plan. The Jansen shaft project is 98% complete and the Jansen Stage 1 project has commenced contract awards.\n\n We have added to our early stage growth options in future facing commodities by executing agreements for interests in additional Australian copper projects in October 2021, including the Elliott project in the Northern Territory, and investing in the Kabanga Nickel Project in Tanzania in December 2021.\n\n Our commitment to a strong balance sheet remains. We have revised our net debt target range to between US$5 and US$15 billion. The revised range will support a resilient balance sheet and retain the flexibility to allocate capital towards shareholder returns and future organic and inorganic investment opportunities. Net debt(i) at 31 December 2021 was US$6.1 billion.\n\nValue and returns: Record interim dividend of US$1.50 per share and Underlying ROCE up to 39.5%\n\n We will pay a record interim dividend of US$1.50 per share or US$7.6 billion, equivalent to a 78% payout ratio(iii).  Underlying return on capital employed(i) strengthened further to 39.5% for total operations.\n\nStrategic actions progressing to plan\n\n In January 2022, BHP completed the unification of BHP’s dual listed corporate structure.\n\n The Cerrejón divestment to Glencore completed in January 2022 and the announced share sale agreement to divest BHP Mitsui Coal (BMC) is expected to complete in the middle of the 2022 calendar year. The review process for New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) is progressing, in line with the two-year timeframe we set last year.\n\n Completion of the proposed merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside is expected in the June 2022 quarter subject to satisfaction of conditions precedent including approval by Woodside shareholders.\n\n 1\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nResults for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\nThe December 2021 half year financial results have been prepared on the basis that the BHP Petroleum business is a discontinued operation. The financial contribution of Petroleum entities impacted has been disclosed as separate line items, “Discontinued operations”, in the BHP Group’s Consolidated Income statement and Consolidated Cash flow statement, and has not been included when calculating the minimum dividend payout. BMC will continue to be consolidated with Queensland Coal as a continuing operation until the expected completion in the middle of the 2022 calendar year. On the Consolidated Balance Sheet, both BMC and BHP Petroleum have been reclassified as assets held for sale and excluded from net operating assets.\n\n        Half year ended 31 December\n\nTotal operations\n\nAttributable profit\n\nBasic earnings per share (cents)\n\nInterim dividend per share (cents)\n\nNet operating cash flow\n\nCapital and exploration expenditure\n\nNet debt\n\nUnderlying attributable profit\n\nUnderlying basic earnings per ordinary share (cents)(i) Continuing operations\n\nProfit from operations\n\nUnderlying EBITDA\n\nUnderlying attributable profit\n\nNet operating cash flow\n\nCapital and exploration expenditure\n\nUnderlying basic earnings per ordinary share (cents)\n\nUnderlying EBITDA including the contribution from Petroleum assets classified as discontinued operations\n\n2021 US$M\n\n2020 Change US$M %\n\n3,876 144% 76.6 144% 101.0 49% 9,369 42% 3,614 2% 11,839 (49%) 6,036 77% 119.4 77%\n\n9,889 50% 13,887 33% 6,200 57% 9,148 26% 2,921 (1%) 122.6 57%\n\n14,680 46%\n\n   9,443\n\n 186.6\n\n150.0 13,277 3,677 6,090 10,687 211.2\n\n  14,845 18,463 9,715 11,529 2,878 192.0\n\n    21,381\n\n                BHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry:\n\n“BHP had a strong first half. We achieved our third consecutive fatality free calendar year. We mitigated the impacts of COVID-19 and significant adverse weather events to turn in a solid operational performance, particularly from our flagship Western Australian Iron Ore business.\n\nWe have announced an interim dividend of US$1.50 per share, bringing total shareholder returns to more than\n\n US$22 billion over the past 18 months.\n\nOur record interim dividend was supported by our reliable operating performance and continued strong markets for a number of our products.\n\nWe have made strong progress on the execution of our strategy. We unified the BHP corporate structure with strong support from shareholders, we announced and advanced the proposed merger of our petroleum business with Woodside, we progressed our divestments of certain coal assets and we announced the final investment decision for our Jansen Stage 1 potash project. We have also secured further growth options in future facing commodities.\n\nBHP is well positioned for the future. We are building on our strong foundations and capital discipline to reshape our business and grow long-term value for shareholders and other stakeholders.”\n\n 2\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nHealth and safety\n\nThe safety, health and wellbeing of our workforce and the communities in which we operate are fundamental priorities for our business. Our global safety improvement programs are progressing and our safety leading indicators have continued a strong underlying positive trend. We have now achieved our third consecutive year without a fatality and we have seen a sustained improvement in our key safety performance indicators. High Potential Injury frequency has decreased by 10 per cent during the half year, a reduction of 36 per cent since 31 December 2018. Total Recordable Injury Frequency has increased slightly, up three per cent during the half year to 3.8, but is 12 per cent lower over the last three years.\n\nCommunity transmission of COVID-19 has increased in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We remain vigilant and continue to escalate or deescalate controls taking into account the prevailing risk as well as guidelines from local and national government bodies and expert health advice in the countries where we operate. Many of these measures remain in an elevated state at present. BHP is strongly encouraging workers who have received their first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccines to receive a booster dose as soon as they are eligible to do so. In Western Australia, a public health direction requires, from 5 February 2022, the majority of resource industry workers to receive a booster dose within one month of becoming eligible, and BHP is actively considering whether to make boosters a requirement for entry to BHP workplaces in other locations.\n\nWe are firmly committed to eliminating incidents of sexual assault and sexual harassment in our workplaces and accommodation villages, and have strengthened our approach to prevention, reporting and response. We have made significant progress in implementing controls to prevent incidents of sexual assault and sexual harassment and to mitigate the impact of incidents that do occur. Areas of focus include increased clarity and enforcement of respectful and safe workplace behaviours, leadership and education, contractor and third-party engagement, security measures at our accommodation villages and support for impacted persons. We also have ongoing engagement with external experts to learn from best practice.\n\nSocial value\n\nWe are committed to creating long-term sustainable value for shareholders and all those who benefit from, or are impacted by, BHP’s business. Social value and long-term financial value are intrinsically linked. We seek out opportunities that grow both social and financial value. Our focus on social value positions us to maximise our contribution more broadly to society – to our employees and contractors, customers and suppliers, governments, Indigenous stakeholders and other communities.\n\nWe demonstrate social value through multiple dimensions – in our operational and business performance and how we achieve it, in our setting and achieving of high standards of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices, and in the nature of our relationships with stakeholders. Social value is not merely a concept or an intent; it involves continued planned delivery of tangible outcomes. Over the course of the first half of the 2022 financial year, among other outcomes, we continued to advance social value in a range of areas including in our interactions with small and medium business enterprises, in supporting workforce skills development, in Indigenous partnerships and on decarbonisation.\n\nEmpowered communities\n\nWe are committed to contributing to the prosperity of the communities where we have a presence. We have continued to support local and Indigenous communities with additional funds to boost COVID-19 vaccine awareness and accessibility. We continue to support local business and training to enhance economic recovery and diversification. From 1 July 2021, we reduced our payment terms for small, local and Indigenous enterprises to 7 days. This came into effect across 31 countries and benefited over 4,000 suppliers.\n\nWe recognise that building capacity and skills is a critical element in the long-term ability of local communities to prosper and thrive. BHP partnered with the Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment to deliver up to 1,000 skills development opportunities in regional Australia, through our voluntary social investment program. Through the Future of Work Program we are working with stakeholders to identify local workforce and business needs in regional areas, and tailoring training opportunities accordingly. The program provides opportunities to unemployed, young and Indigenous Australians across the regions where BHP operates to develop skills and better access employment. It also helps small, medium and Indigenous-run businesses to upskill employees, including skills to work in a digital environment, taking advantage of new opportunities we expect to be created through the economic recovery.\n\n3\n\nBHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nWe also fund the BHP Foundation, which continues to work with partner organisations globally to address some of the world’s most critical sustainable development challenges. These efforts are designed to address challenges that are directly relevant to the global resources sector and contribute towards many of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals focusing on the governance of natural resources, environmental resilience and education equity. The BHP Foundation’s global partnerships extend across 32 projects and 49 countries, including ‘Opening Extractives’, led by Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and Open Ownership, supporting governments to transform the availability and use of beneficial ownership data for effective governance in the extractives sector and helping to end the use of anonymous companies; and the 10 Deserts Project which has established the world’s largest network of Indigenous-managed conservation areas spanning more than 35 per cent of Australia. Further information can be found at: bhp.com/foundation.\n\nInclusion\n\nWe are progressing a number of improvements to ensure our workplaces are culturally safe, free from any form of harassment, racial discrimination and vilification, or bullying. This includes ensuring that allegations of racial discrimination and vilification are investigated by BHP’s Central Investigations Team, which is separate to the functional or operational area of occurrence. A decision was taken in September 2020 that all allegations of racial discrimination and vilification are to be assigned to the most serious investigation category. We are also taking steps to address racial pay disparity. In the US, we have piloted a survey that included information on ethnic background. This supported a pay equity review and resultant adjustments. We are in the process of rolling the survey out company-wide in the 2022 calendar year. In our Commercial function based in Singapore, we have increased our Asian leadership from 43 per cent in May 2021 to 54 per cent in December 2021. We will continue to work with our people, industry peers and external experts to lift our performance and that of the industry.\n\nGender diversity\n\nWe continue to build a more inclusive and diverse workforce that better reflects the communities in which we operate and further enhances performance. This includes our aspirational goal of a gender balanced workforce by the end of the 2025 financial year. In the first half of the 2022 financial year, 46 per cent of our external hires were female, which has resulted in a further increase of female representation in the workforce, up 0.8 percentage points to 30.6 per cent. The Executive Leadership Team established in the 2020 calendar year is gender balanced.\n\nIndigenous partnerships\n\nWe recognise the connection of Indigenous peoples to the land and water, and we seek to recognise this by listening, learning and building shared understandings and objectives. Our approach to cultural heritage focuses on building and maintaining genuine and mutually beneficial partnerships with Indigenous peoples and is driven by the commitments made in our Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement, our Indigenous Peoples Strategy and our Regional Indigenous Peoples plans, including the Australian Reconciliation Action Plan. These plans include key targets for increasing Indigenous representation in the workforce and engaging with Indigenous businesses. Indigenous representation has increased across all operating regions and BHP has spent over US$69 million in the December 2021 half year with Indigenous and First Nation’s businesses globally.\n\nDuring the half year, we continued to work with Indigenous groups and representative organisations to further strengthen our cultural heritage management practices. We recognise our responsibility to respect and sustain the cultural landscapes in which we operate and work in partnership to ensure we respect the rights of the Indigenous peoples who are its custodians. We also continue to support efforts to further strengthen the laws, policies and practices that regulate the management of cultural heritage values. In August 2021, and after a year of negotiations, the Barada Barna Aboriginal Corporation, on behalf of the Barada Barna people, and BMC signed a Native Title Project Agreement for South Walker Creek Mine in Central Queensland.\n\nOur progress on decarbonisation\n\nClimate Transition Action Plan\n\nIn September 2021, we released our Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP), which was strongly supported by shareholders through the non-binding advisory ‘Say on Climate’ shareholder vote at our Annual General Meetings in 2021. The CTAP outlines BHP’s updated approach to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and managing climate risks across our global value chain, including the detail of our value chain (Scope 3) net zero goal.\n\n  4\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nBHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\nWe expect our diversified portfolio to be resilient under a number of different long-term scenarios, and we continue to pursue opportunities to further strengthen our portfolio and our exposure to long-term decarbonisation trends.\n\nOur progress on operational decarbonisation (Scope 1 and Scope 2)\n\nWe have made progress on actions required to meet our medium-term target and long-term goal to reduce operational emissions. In January 2022, Escondida and Spence completed the transition to four renewable power contracts to increase flexibility for our power portfolio, as part of our continued aim to supply Escondida and Spence’s energy requirements from 100 per cent renewable energy sources by the mid-2020s.\n\nIn Australia, Olympic Dam partnered with Iberdrola at the Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park to reduce Olympic Dam’s emissions position to zero from 50 per cent of its electricity consumption by 2025, based on current forecast demand. This follows BHP’s entry into renewable energy agreements for our operations in Nickel West in 2021 and Queensland Coal in 2020.\n\nTo support our goal to achieve net-zero operational GHG emissions by 2050, BHP has become a founding member of Komatsu’s GHG Alliance, which aims to develop commercially viable zero-greenhouse gas emissions haul trucks. We are also working in partnership with Caterpillar Inc. to accelerate their development and deployment of zero-emissions mining trucks at BHP operations.\n\nOur progress on value chain decarbonisation (Scope 3)\n\nWe have made progress on actions to support the reduction of value chain emissions through partnerships with our customers. COP26 in Glasgow highlighted the increasing importance on collaboration for ‘breakthrough’ discoveries, particularly in steelmaking. In October 2021, BHP announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with South Korea’s POSCO, one of the world’s largest steelmakers, to undertake pilot and plant trials to reduce emissions in the steelmaking process. This, combined with other MoUs, means we now have partnerships with major steelmakers with a combined output of approximately 12 per cent of reported global steel production. In November 2021, we officially joined the Global Low-carbon Metallurgical Innovation Alliance, with the aim of boosting the global steel industry's low-carbon transformation. The alliance, initiated by China Baowu Steel Group, is comprised of 62 enterprises, colleges and universities and scientific research institutions from 15 countries.\n\nIn the first half of the 2022 financial year, we also announced a collaboration with Tesla Inc. to make the nickel-based battery supply chain more sustainable, with a focus on end-to-end raw material traceability using blockchain technology. BHP also entered into a MoU with Toyota Tsusho Corporation and Japan’s Prime Planet Energy & Solutions to create a Green Electric Vehicle Ecosystem that will seek to enhance sustainability, recyclability and traceability, starting with nickel sulphate supply.\n\nIn maritime, BHP signed the Call to Action for Shipping Decarbonisation to urge world leaders to align shipping with the goals of the Paris Agreement. This is one dimension of our commitment to maritime decarbonisation, which includes our new target, announced in September 2021, of net zero by 2050 for greenhouse gas emissions from all shipping of our products by 2050, subject to the widespread availability of carbon neutral solutions, including low/zero-emission technology on board suitable ships and low/zero-emission marine fuels(iv).\n\nValue chain stewardship\n\nBHP was awarded the Copper Mark for Escondida, Spence and Olympic Dam. The Copper Mark is an assurance framework specific to the copper industry, developed to ensure that value chain participants demonstrate best practice in responsible production and contribute to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Additionally, BHP and leading US copper cable and wire manufacturer, Southwire, have completed their first ‘carbon neutral’(v) copper transaction involving delivery from BHP’s mines in Chile to Southwire’s processing activities in Georgia, United States.\n\nEnvironmental performance\n\nWe are on track to achieve our five-year target to reduce FY22 fresh water withdrawal by 15 per cent from FY17 levels.\n\nThe importance of the intersection between biodiversity and climate effects was noted at several major intergovernmental meetings in 2021. A new US$3.3 million research program by BHP and CSIRO, Australia’s national science agency, will seek to measure and quantify the net emissions reduction potential of Australia’s mangroves, seagrasses and tidal marshes, which can absorb carbon faster than land-based forests. They also provide coastal communities with essential benefits for coastal protection, fish production and biodiversity. This project aims to develop metrics to measure these benefits for incorporation into Australian and international standards.\n\n 5\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nAs part of BHP’s commitment to contribute to environmental resilience and biodiversity outcomes in a collaborative way, BHP joined the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum, a global multi-disciplinary consultative group of institutions seeking to develop and deliver a natured-based risk management and disclosure framework. It aims to support a shift in global financial flows away from nature-negative outcomes and toward nature-positive ones.\n\n Social value: key indicators scorecard(1)\n\n      H1 Target FY22\n\nH2 H1 FY21 FY21\n\n0 0 0.20 0.20\n\n3.7 3.6 8.0 8.2\n\n \n\n \n\n60.9 52.6 144.3 30.5 1,064 1,112\n\n29.8 27.4\n\n7.2 6.7\n\n7.5 6.8 13.7 12.8\n\nFY21 Comment\n\n0 No fatalities at our operated assets over the last 36 months.\n\n0.20 36 per cent reduction since 31 December 2018.\n\n3.7 12 per cent reduction over the last three years.\n\n16.2 On track to meet our FY22 and FY30 targets with the reductions in emissions from renewable power contracts at Escondida, Spence, Queensland Coal, Nickel West and Olympic Dam.\n\n On track to deliver 2030 goal with MoU with South Korea’s POSCO signed in H1 FY22.\n\n On track to deliver 2030 goal.\n\n113.5 On track to meet our five-year target.\n\n174.8 On track to deliver our target.\n\n2,176 Over US$1.9 billion directed to local suppliers in each of the past two financial years.\n\n29.8 74 per cent increase from FY16(5), with 46 per cent female external hires in H1 FY21.\n\n7.2 Assets continue to focus on Indigenous employment.\n\n7.5 Assets continue to focus on Indigenous employment.\n\n13.7 Assets continue to focus on Indigenous employment.\n\n      Fatalities\n\nHigh Potential Injury (HPI) frequency(vi) (per million hours worked)\n\nTRIF(vi)\n\n(per million hours worked)\n\nOperational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions(vi)\n\n(Mt CO2-e)\n\nValue chain emissions(vi)\n\nFreshwater withdrawals(vi) (GL)\n\nCommunity and social investment\n\n(US$M)\n\nLocal procurement spend (US$M)\n\nFemale workforce participation(vi) (%)\n\nIndigenous workforce participation(vi) (%)\n\nZero work-related fatalities\n\nYear-on-year improvement in HPI frequency\n\nYear-on-year improvement in TRIF\n\nMaintain FY22 operational GHG emissions at or below FY17 levels(2)(3) while we continue to grow our business and reduce emissions by at least 30 per cent from FY20 levels(3) by FY30\n\nSteelmaking: 2030 goal to support industry to develop technologies and pathways capable of 30 per cent emissions intensity reduction in integrated steelmaking, with widespread adoption expected post-2030\n\nMaritime transportation: 2030 goal to support 40 per cent emissions intensity reduction of BHP- chartered shipping of our products\n\nReduce FY22 freshwater withdrawals by 15 per cent from FY17 levels(4)\n\nNo less than one per cent of pre-tax profit (three-year rolling average)\n\nSupport the growth of local businesses in the regions where we operate\n\nAspirational goal for gender balance by the end of FY25\n\nAustralia: aim to achieve 8.0 per cent by the end of FY25\n\nChile: aim to achieve 10.0 per cent by the end of FY26\n\nCanada – Potash: aim to achieve 20.0 per cent by the end of FY27\n\n0 0.18\n\n3.8 6.8\n\n\n\n\n\n55.3\n\n46.9 1,172 30.6 8.0\n\n8.5 13.7\n\n                                                                           (1) All data points are presented on a total operations basis and are subject to non-financial assurance reviews.

Greenhouse gas emissions are subject to final sustainability assurance review.\n\n(3) FY17 and FY20 baselines will be adjusted for any material acquisitions and divestments based on GHG emissions at the completion of the transaction. Carbon offsets will be used as required.\n\n(4) In FY17, our fresh water withdrawals were 156.1 GL (on an adjusted basis, excluding Onshore US). The FY17 baseline data has been adjusted to account for: the materiality of the strike affecting water withdrawals at Escondida in FY17 and improvements to water balance methodologies at WAIO and Queensland Coal and exclusion of hypersaline, wastewater, entrainment, supplies from desalination and Discontinued operations (Onshore US assets) in FY19 and FY20.\n\n(5) In FY16, our female representation was 17.6%.\n\n6\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nSamarco\n\nBHP Brasil remains committed to Samarco supporting the Renova Foundation and its work to progress the remediation and compensatory programs to restore the environment and re-establish communities affected by the Fundão dam failure, as set out in the Framework Agreement entered into in March 2016 by BHP Brasil, Samarco, Vale and relevant Brazilian authorities.\n\nIn total, Renova has spent R$19.6 billion (approximately US$4.2 billion(vii)) on remediation and compensation programs to 31 December 2021.\n\nCompensation and financial assistance increased to a total of approximately R$8.7 billion (approximately US$1.8 billion(vii)) in payments to support approximately 370,000 people affected by the Fundão dam failure. This includes approximately 51,200 payments paid through the court-mandated “Novel System”. Resettlement of communities continues to progress, with 128 resettlement cases across the region completed, and a further 176 in progress, through construction of houses and public buildings, allocation of plots or cash payments.\n\nNegotiations are ongoing with State and Federal Prosecutors and other Brazilian public authorities on the review of the Framework Agreement, seeking a definitive and substantive settlement of claims relating to the dam failure.\n\nIn October 2021, the 12th Federal Court delivered a ruling that expanded the scope of eligible individuals of the court mandated compensation process (“Novel System”), extended its geographical scope and increased indemnification amounts for certain categories of damage. While the decision is under appeal and applications have been made to clarify certain aspects of the ruling, the ruling has been considered in determining the cost estimates that form the basis of the Group’s dam failure provision as at 31 December 2021. The Group’s provisions related to the Samarco dam failure have increased by US$327 million since 30 June 2021, to a total of US$3.1 billion as at 31 December 2021.\n\nIn the December 2021 half year, BHP reported an exceptional loss of US$821 million (after tax) in relation to the Fundão dam failure. This predominantly reflected an increase in cost estimates for the Samarco dam failure provision, primarily as a result of the 12th Federal Court’s decision and fair value change on forward exchange derivatives. Additional commentary is included on page 47.\n\nSamarco’s Judicial Reorganisation process is continuing in the Commercial Courts of Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais. The Judicial Reorganisation is a process for Samarco to restructure its financial debts in order to establish a sustainable independent financial position that would allow Samarco to continue its operations safely and meet its Renova Foundation obligations. BHP Brasil will continue to support Samarco in this process.\n\n7\n\nBHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nFinancial performance\n\nNote: All guidance is subject to further potential impacts from COVID-19 during the 2022 financial year\n\nEarnings and margins\n\n• Attributable profit of US$9.4 billion includes an exceptional loss of US$1.2 billion (31 December 2020: US$3.9 billion, which included an exceptional loss of US$2.2 billion).\n\n• The exceptional loss of US$1.2 billion (after tax) relates to the current half year impact of the Samarco dam failure of US$821 million as well as an impairment of US deferred tax assets no longer expected to be recoverable after the Petroleum demerger of US$423 million.\n\n• Underlying attributable profit of US$10.7 billion for total operations (31 December 2020: US$6.0 billion) was underpinned by disciplined cost performance across our operations.\n\n• Profit from operations (continuing operations) of US$14.8 billion (31 December 2020: US$9.9 billion) increased as a result of higher sales prices across our major commodities, near record production at WAIO and higher concentrate sales at Spence, and favourable exchange rate movements. This was partially offset by the impacts from planned maintenance across a number of our assets, expected copper grade decline at Escondida, significant wet weather at Queensland Coal and inflationary pressures, including higher fuel, energy and consumable prices.\n\n• The total impact from COVID-19 on our operations was US$223 million (pre-tax) (31 December 2020: US$405 million). This represents the following impacts: lower volumes at our operated assets of US$69 million (31December 2020: US$138 million) and direct costs of US$154 million incurred (31 December 2020: US$267 million, reported as an exceptional item), such as social distancing measures including additional charter flights, accommodation, security and health and hygiene services and also temporary relocation costs due to border restrictions, combined with higher demurrage and other standby charges due to delays caused by COVID-19.\n\n• Underlying EBITDA (continuing operations) of US$18.5 billion (31 December 2020: US$13.9 billion), with an increased EBITDA margin (continuing operations) of 64 per cent (31 December 2020: 60 per cent). Additional commentary is included on page 15.\n\n• Underlying return on capital employed strengthened to 39.5 per cent (31 December 2020: 23.6 per cent). Underlying return on capital employed, excluding Petroleum, is approximately 42.9 per cent.\n\nCosts\n\n• Full year unit cost guidance for WAIO and Escondida remains unchanged (based on exchange rates of AUD/USD 0.78 and USD/CLP 727). Unit cost guidance for Queensland Coal has been increased, reflecting lower expected volumes for the full year as previously announced.\n\n• Unit costs(i) at WAIO are below guidance at the half year (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.78) and are tracking towards the lower end of the guidance range on a full year basis. WAIO unit costs, on a C1 basis excluding third party royalties, were 18 per cent higher than the prior period at US$14.74 per tonne (31 December 2020: US$12.46 per tonne) driven by higher diesel prices (US$0.84 per tonne) and costs associated with the South Flank ramp up (US$0.82 per tonne).\n\n• Escondida unit costs were at the top end of the guidance range (based on an exchange rate of USD/CLP 727) and reflect the planned lower concentrator feed grade. Concentrator feed grade is expected to improve in the June 2022 half year as the mine sequence moves towards higher grade areas.\n\n• Queensland Coal unit costs are tracking above the revised guidance range at the half year (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.78) primarily due to lower volumes in the first half due to significant wet weather impacts and labour constraints. A stronger second half performance is expected following planned maintenance undertaken in the first half, however COVID-19 related absenteeism impacts remain a risk for the second half of the 2022 financial year.\n\n 8\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n• Historical costs and guidance for our major assets are summarised below:\n\nMedium-term FY22 exchange exchange\n\nBHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\n        guidance(1) guidance(1)\n\n<1.10 1.20 - 1.40 <16 17.50 - 18.50 −(6) 85 - 94\n\n−(7) −(7)\n\nrates(1)\n\n1.40 17.38 98.63\n\n10.82\n\nrates(2)\n\nH1 FY21(3)\n\nH1 FY22 at guidance realised\n\nH1 FY22(2) vs H1 FY21(3) 43% 12% 8%\n\n2%\n\n        Escondida unit cost (US$/lb)\n\nWAIO unit cost (US$/t)(4) Queensland Coal unit cost (US$/t)(5) Discontinued operations Petroleum unit cost (US$/boe)\n\n1.29 0.90 16.15 14.38 91.39 84.92\n\n10.51 10.30\n\n                                 (1) FY22 and medium-term unit cost guidance are based on exchange rates of AUD/USD 0.78 and USD/CLP 727.\n\n(2) Average realised exchange rates for H1 FY22 of AUD/USD 0.73 and USD/CLP 798.\n\n(3) H1 FY21 unit costs exclude the impact from COVID-19 which was reported as an exceptional item.\n\n(4) WAIO unit costs exclude freight and government royalties.

Our near-term focus remains on sustainable achievement of 290 Mtpa, with plans to creep beyond this through productivity improvements in the medium term.\n\n(4) We announced the share sale agreement to divest our interest in BMC in November 2021, however we will continue to report BMC as part of Queensland Coal and we maintain economic and operating control of BMC until the sale has completed.\n\n(5) Coal imports into China remains uncertain and as a result Queensland Coal medium-term production guidance is not able to be provided.\n\n(6) We have ceased providing Cerrejón production guidance due to the completion of the divestment of our interest. The transaction has an effective economic date of 31 December 2020 and volumes have been reported separately.\n\n(7) Given our announcement of a binding share sale agreement for the proposed merger of BHP’s oil and gas portfolio with Woodside in November 2021, no further annual production guidance for Petroleum will be provided. However, until merger completion, we expect a production run rate broadly consistent with the original FY22 production guidance of between 99 and 106 MMboe.\n\n9\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nCash flow and balance sheet\n\n• Net operating cash flows (continuing operations) of US$11.5 billion (31 December 2020: 9.1 billion) reflects strong prices across our major commodities and a reliable operating performance during the period. This includes an unfavourable working capital movement of US$2.2 billion largely related to inventory builds, net price impacts on receivables and royalties, and other movements. Income tax and royalty-related taxation payments of US$5.0 billion include approximately US$2.0 billion of tax instalments and final tax payments relating to the 2021 financial year.\n\n• Free cash flow (continuing operations) of US$8.5 billion for the half year (31 December 2020: US$5.9 billion), and free cash flow of US$9.7 billion (total operations), inclusive of capital and exploration expenditure of US$3.7 billion.\n\n• Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt at US$6.1 billion at 31 December 2021 (30 June 2021: US$4.1 billion; 31 December 2020: US$11.8 billion). The increase of US$2.0 billion in net debt in the half year (or a decrease of US$5.7 billion from 31 December 2020) reflects strong free cash flow generation by the operations more than offset by the record final dividend paid to shareholders in September 2021 of US$10.0 billion, dividends paid to non-controlling interests of US$1.3 billion and US$0.5 billion of lease additions.\n\n       Net debt at the beginning of the period Lease additions\n\nFree cash flow\n\nDividends paid\n\nDividends paid to NCI\n\nTransfer to liability directly associated with assets held for sale Other movements\n\nNet debt at the end of the period\n\nH1 FY22 US$M 4,121 497 (9,688) 10,029 1,273 (528) 386 6,090\n\nH1 FY21 US$M 12,044 909 (5,160) 2,767 762 − 517 11,839\n\n     • Following a review of the net debt target, we have revised the range to between US$5 and US$15 billion from the previous target range of between US$12 and US$17 billion. The revised net debt target range will enable BHP to maintain a resilient balance sheet during periods of change and external uncertainties and retain flexibility to allocate capital within our Capital Allocation Framework towards shareholder returns and future organic and inorganic investment opportunities.\n\n• Gearing ratio(i) of 10.0 per cent (30 June 2021: 6.9 per cent; 31 December 2020: 18.1 per cent).\n\nDividends\n\n• We will pay a record interim dividend of US$1.50 per share or US$7.6 billion, including an additional amount of US$2.7 billion above the minimum payout policy. This is equivalent to a 78 per cent payout ratio(iii) (31 December 2020: 85 per cent).\n\n• We have consistently delivered high cash returns, with more than US$22 billion of total announced returns to shareholders over the last 18 months.\n\nCapital and exploration\n\n• Capital and exploration expenditure of US$3.7 billion (total operations) in the December 2021 half year included maintenance expenditure(viii) of US$1.1 billion, minerals exploration of US$0.1 billion and Petroleum expenditure of US$0.8 billion.\n\n• Capital and exploration expenditure of approximately US$6.5 billion (continuing operations) is now expected for the 2022 financial year. This is US$0.2 billion lower than previous guidance predominantly due to favourable exchange rate movements. Guidance is subject to exchange rate movements.\n\n10\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nBHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\n • Historical capital and exploration expenditure and guidance are summarised below:\n\nDevelopment - Minerals\n\nCapital expenditure (purchases of property, plant and equipment)\n\nAdd: exploration expenditure\n\nCapital expenditure - Continuing operations\n\nCapital expenditure - Discontinued operations\n\nCapital and exploration expenditure - Total operations\n\nH1 FY21 US$M 1,034 1,801 2,835 86 2,921 693 3,614\n\nFY21 US$M 2,259 3,353 5,612 192 5,804 1,316 7,120\n\n     FY22e US$M Maintenance(1) 2,800\n\nH1 FY22 US$M 1,090 3,500 1,678 6,300 2,768 200 110 6,500 2,878 −(2) 799 − 3,677\n\n                               (1) Includes capitalised deferred stripping of approximately US$800 million for FY22 and US$409 million for H1 FY22 (H1 FY21: US$396 million; FY21: $810 million).\n\n(2) Given our announcement of a binding share sale agreement for the proposed merger of BHP’s oil and gas portfolio with Woodside in November 2021, no further capital and exploration guidance for Petroleum will be provided.\n\n• Average annual sustaining capital expenditure guidance over the medium term, excluding costs associated with carbon abatement and our automation programs, is unchanged and forecast to be approximately:\n\n‒ US$4.50 per tonne for WAIO; and\n\n‒ US$10 per tonne for Queensland Coal.\n\n• Capital expenditure on decarbonisation is expected to be at the upper end of the guidance range of between US$2 to US$4 billion until the 2030 calendar year.\n\nProjects\n\n• At the end of December 2021, BHP had two major projects under development, the US$2.97 billion Jansen mine shafts project and the US$5.7 billion Jansen Stage 1 project.\n\n• Major projects are summarised below:\n\nCommodity Project and ownership Project scope / capacity(1)\n\nProjects in execution at 31 December 2021 – continuing operations\n\nCapital expenditure(1) initial\n\n      Date of US$M production\n\nProgress / comments\n\nThe project is 98% complete.

Our near-term focus remains on sustainable achievement of 290 Mtpa of iron ore, with plans to creep beyond this through productivity improvements in the medium term.\n\n• We continue to progress with the implementation of autonomous trucks across our Australian iron ore and coal mine sites.\n\n‒ In December 2021, we approved the South Flank Autonomous Haulage Project to automate the current fleet of 41 Komatsu haul trucks. The project is scheduled to commence in the June 2022 quarter and is expected to be completed within 18 months.\n\n‒ At the Daunia coal mine in Central Queensland, the second coal operation to implement autonomous haul trucks, all trucks are now commissioned and operational, on schedule and budget.\n\n‒ At the Goonyella Riverside mine in Queensland, the first coal site to implement autonomous haul trucks, the deployment of 86 autonomous trucks continues in line with the plan and is expected to be completed in the middle of the 2022 calendar year, on schedule and budget.\n\nOperations Services\n\nOperations Services performs business critical services across our minerals operations in Australia, including maintaining a significant portion of ultra-class trucks and moving significant volumes of material as part of production services. At 31 December 2021, Operations Services was responsible across Minerals Australia for maintaining 38 per cent of BHP's haul trucks, including 92 per cent of ultra-class trucks at BMA, and the 308 km of conveyors in our WAIO operations.\n\nThe BHP FutureFit Academy, launched in May 2020, has welcomed over 520 students and graduated over 200 maintenance associates during this period. The FutureFit Academy extended its curriculum to Production in 2021 and is now able to deliver a nationally accredited qualification in Surface Extraction Operations.\n\nOutlook\n\nEconomic outlook\n\nWe remain positive in our outlook for long-term global economic growth and commodity demand. Population growth, the infrastructure of decarbonisation and rising living standards are all expected to drive demand for energy, metals and fertilisers for decades to come.\n\nIn the near term, volatility in the operating environment is expected to continue. Momentum towards recovery remains intact across most key regions, although China slowed over the second half of the 2021 calendar year, and vigilance around COVID-19 risks is still a constant for all. We anticipate that the headwinds that buffeted China will diminish as the 2022 calendar proceeds. A desynchronised exit from emergency policy settings around the globe is a source of uncertainty.\n\nIndustry wide inflationary pressure has been pronounced, lifting and steepening operating cost curves and challenging timely project delivery. Many commodity-linked uncontrollable costs have moved noticeably higher, in some cases to record highs. Labour costs have increased materially due to localised shortages of both general and skilled workers. This partly reflects regulatory constraints on movement across international and state borders. We expect cost headwinds due to supply bottlenecks to remain challenging in the 2022 calendar year, with only tentative signs of easing by the end of the period. As the actual recognition of costs tends to lag developments in prompt pricing, these pressures are expected to continue to impact on our cost base in the following calendar year. Demand-led inflation in the broader economy, reflecting a healthy tension between rising demand and the ability to meet it, is expected to endure for some time. That is fundamentally positive for the resources industry. After more than half a decade of industry wide capital discipline, positive developments in demand are broadly expected to manifest in tighter market balances. That can potentially prolong the period of attractive pricing that we currently observe across the portfolio. Low cost operators stand to capture increased margins in certain commodities.\n\n 12\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nCommodities outlook\n\nIn the half year ended 31 December 2021, the key theme in steel was a policy induced production crunch in China. The starting point for Chinese output expectations in the 2022 calendar year is zero growth from the 1.033 Bt produced in 2021. End-use demand in China is expected to firm over the course of the 2022 calendar year, as easier policy gradually takes hold. As is common at the start of a new five-year plan, infrastructure is expected to be supportive of steel demand.\n\nIron ore prices declined in the first half of the 2022 financial year as China’s steel production curbs took hold, while seaborne supply improved. Prices have since stabilised and recovered, albeit not to the previous highs. In the medium term, China’s demand for iron ore is expected to be lower than it is today as crude steel production plateaus and the scrap-to-steel ratio rises. In the long-term, prices are expected to be determined by high cost production, on a value-in- use adjusted basis, from Australia or Brazil. It is imperative that we continue to compete on both quality and operational effectiveness.\n\nMetallurgical coal prices surged to record highs in the first half of the 2022 financial year on multi-regional supply constraints amidst challenging operating conditions. Even so, the industry faces a difficult and uncertain period ahead while natural trade flows are impaired. Longer term, high quality metallurgical coals will continue to provide value-in-use benefits to integrated steelmakers as they seek to optimise the energy and emissions intensity of their operations. This will particularly be the case in emerging Asia, where the blast furnace fleet is still young, and transitional technologies are expected to dominate decarbonisation efforts in the next 20-30 years.\n\nEnergy coal prices reached all-time highs in the first half of the 2022 financial year as constrained supply coincided with very strong demand from both Asia and Europe. China’s policy in respect of energy coal imports remains a key medium-term uncertainty.\n\nCopper prices have receded slightly from the record highs established in the second half of the 2021 financial year, but they remain very high in absolute terms. Longer term, both demand and supply factors indicate that copper is an attractive avenue for future growth.\n\nNickel prices performed well over the first half of the 2022 financial year and the positive momentum continues. Depleting stocks was a recurrent theme over the half, with strong demand from both traditional uses and batteries coupled with supply uncertainty. Longer term, we believe nickel will be a core beneficiary of the electrification mega- trend and that nickel sulphides will be particularly attractive.\n\nPotash prices have increased sharply over the last 18 months, despite latent excess production capacity. Longer term, potash stands to benefit from the intersection of a number of global megatrends: rising population, changing diets and the need for the sustainable intensification of agriculture. The compelling demand picture, and the maturity of the existing asset base, offers an attractive entry opportunity for a world class operation later this decade.\n\nCrude oil prices traded in an approximate range of US$65-85 per bbl (Brent) over the last half year, with prices moving above US$90 per bbl early in the current half. Beyond the current phase, considerable investment is going to be required to fill the medium and longer term supply-demand gap we expect to emerge. If that investment is not forthcoming in a timely way, the possibility of oil prices moving up aggressively cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe Japan-Korea Marker price for LNG has been extremely elevated, with all-time high spot pricing achieved in the lead-up to the northern hemisphere winter. Longer term, assets advantaged by their proximity to existing infrastructure or customers, or both, in addition to competitive emissions intensities, are expected to be attractive.\n\nFurther information on BHP’s economic and commodity outlook can be found at: bhp.com/prospects\n\nBHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\n  13\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nNews release\n\nIncome statement\n\nUnderlying attributable profit and Underlying EBITDA are presented below.\n\nUnderlying attributable profit\n\nHalf year ended 31 December\n\nProfit after taxation attributable to BHP shareholders\n\nTotal exceptional items attributable to BHP shareholders(1)\n\nUnderlying attributable profit\n\n(Profit)/loss after taxation attributable to members of BHP for Discontinued operations Total exceptional items attributable to BHP shareholders for Discontinued operations Underlying attributable profit – Continuing operations\n\nWeighted basic average number of shares (Million)\n\nUnderlying basic earnings per ordinary share – Continuing operations\n\n2021 US$M 9,443 1,244 10,687 (972) − 9,715\n\n5,061\n\n192.0\n\n2020 US$M Restated 3,876 2,160 6,036 192 (28) 6,200\n\n5,057\n\n122.6\n\n                     (1) Refer to page 17 and to note 2 ‘Exceptional items’ and note 10 ‘Significant events – Samarco dam failure’ of the Financial Report for further information.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA\n\nHalf year ended 31 December\n\nProfit from operations\n\nExceptional items included in profit from operations(1)\n\nUnderlying EBIT\n\nDepreciation and amortisation expense\n\nNet impairments\n\nExceptional item included in Depreciation, amortisation and impairments(2) Underlying EBITDA\n\n2020 2021 US$M US$M Restated 14,845 9,889 729 1,511 15,574 11,400 2,851 2,405 38 629 − (547) 18,463 13,887\n\n                 (1) Exceptional items loss of US$729 million excludes net finance costs of US$93 million related to the Samarco dam failure.

The Petroleum business remains part of the Group until completion of the proposed merger which is expected in the June 2022 quarter. In the meantime, following that announcement, the Group’s Petroleum business no longer meets the reporting segment recognition criteria as outlined in IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’ and therefore does not form part of the reportable segments summarised above. A detailed summary of performance of the Petroleum assets presented as a single amount in the line item entitled ‘Profit/(loss) after taxation from discontinued operations’ is outlined below. Refer to note 11 ‘Discontinued operations and Assets and liabilities held for sale’ of the Financial Report for further information.\n\nHalf year ended 31 December 2021 3,257 2,918 2,037 − 8,245 556 243 112 Half year ended 31 December 2020 1,595 793 (108) (31) 8,548 498 195 242\n\n(2) Group and segment level information is reported on a statutory basis which reflects the application of the equity accounting method in preparing the Group financial statements – in accordance with IFRS. Underlying EBITDA of the Group and the reportable segments, includes depreciation, amortisation and impairments (D&A), net finance costs and taxation expense of US$300 million (H1 FY21: US$259 million) related to equity accounted investments. It excludes exceptional items loss of US$702 million (H1 FY21: US$678 million loss) related to share of profit/loss from equity accounted investments, related impairments and expenses.\n\nGroup profit before taxation comprised Underlying EBITDA, exceptional items, depreciation, amortisation and impairments of US$3,618 million (H1 FY21: US$3,998 million) and net finance costs of US$352 million (H1 FY21: US$876 million).\n\n(3) Revenue is based on Group realised prices and includes third party products. Sale of third party products by the Group contributed revenue of US$1,674 million and Underlying EBITDA of US$10 million (H1 FY21: US$958 million and US$58 million).\n\n(4) For more information on the reconciliation of certain alternative performance measures to our statutory measures, reasons for usefulness and calculation methodology, please refer to alternative performance measures set on pages 62 to 74.\n\n(5) Exceptional items loss of US$729 million excludes net finance costs of US$93 million included in the total loss before taxation of US$822 million related to the Samarco dam failure.

In the prior period, costs benefited from a one-off gain from the cancelled power contracts at Escondida and Spence. This was partially offset by lower costs at Olympic Dam reflecting favourable inventory movements as a result of reduced operational activity during the major smelter maintenance campaign.\n\n242 (116)\n\n(176) Predominantly higher diesel and acid prices.\n\n19 Higher capitalisation due to increased waste movement at Escondida.\n\n70 Other includes increased profit at Antamina driven by higher realised prices for both copper and zinc.\n\n4,272\n\nEscondida unit costs increased by 43 per\n\nconsumables, lower by-product credits and\n\nWhilst inflationary pressures persist, the unit\n\nend-of-negotiation workforce bonus payments, and a gain recorded in the prior period as a result of cancelled power contracts as the mine shifts towards 100 per cent renewable energy.\n\nFull year unit cost guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between US$1.20 and US$1.40 per pound (based on an exchange rate of USD/CLP 727). In the medium term, we expect unit costs to be less than US$1.10 per pound (based on an exchange rate of USD/CLP 727), with further operational efficiency and maintenance improvements expected to offset higher power consumption and water costs, as well as grade decline.\n\n  Underlying EBITDA for the half year ended 31 December 2020\n\nNet price impact:\n\nChange in sales prices\n\nPrice-linked costs Change in volumes\n\nChange in controllable cash costs\n\nChange in other costs: Exchange rates\n\nInflation\n\nFuel, energy, and consumable price movements Non-cash\n\nOther\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\n              cent to US$1.29 per pound, as expected, reflecting higher prices for\n\nincremental costs associated with mitigating the impacts of COVID-19. cost increase for the half year largely relates to one-off impacts, including\n\n        Escondida unit costs (US$M)\n\nRevenue\n\nUnderlying EBITDA\n\nGross costs\n\nLess: by-product credits Less: freight\n\nNet costs\n\nSales (kt)\n\nSales (Mlb)\n\nCost per pound (US$)(1)(2)(3)\n\n(1) H1 FY22 based on average exchange rates of USD/CLP 798.\n\nH1 FY22\n\n4,829 3,124 1,705\n\n214\n\n103\n\n1,388\n\n487 1,074 1.29\n\nH2 FY21\n\n4,954 3,464 1,490\n\n206 83 1,201 490 1,080 1.11\n\nH1 FY21\n\n4,516 3,019 1,497\n\n272 79 1,146 576 1,270 0.90\n\nFY21\n\n9,470 6,483 2,987\n\n478\n\n162\n\n2,347\n\n1,066 2,350 1.00\n\n                                                                         (2) H1 FY22 includes COVID-19 related costs of US$0.03 per pound, which was reported as an exceptional item in FY21 (H1 FY21: US$0.02 per pound; FY21: US$0.03 per pound).\n\n(3) H1 FY21 and FY21 included a gain from the optimised outcome from renegotiation of cancelled power contracts of US$0.07 per pound and US$0.04 per pound respectively.\n\nSGO demonstrated full concentrator throughput of 95 ktpd in the December 2021 quarter. However, plant design modifications, including modifications to the rougher flotation circuit will be required to increase SGO recoveries and achieve planned copper production levels.

The increase in unit cost was mostly due to higher diesel prices reflecting inflationary headwinds, price-linked third party royalties, costs associated with the ramp up of South Flank, and costs associated with COVID- 19 of approximately US$0.56 per tonne, which has been taken to unit costs in this period and reported as an exceptional item in the prior period. Sales volumes were slightly lower due to the impact of temporary labour constraints relating to COVID-19 border restrictions. The cost increase was partially offset by the impact of favourable exchange rate movements.\n\nFull year unit cost guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged and is trending towards the lower end at between US$17.50 and US$18.50 per tonne (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.78).

The Group’s investment in Cerrejón has subsequently been classified as ‘Assets held for sale’ and therefore excluded from net operating assets. At 31 December 2021, the Group's investment in Cerrejón continued to be classified as 'Assets held for sale' and measured at fair value in line with the divestment consideration. During the half year ended 31 December 2021, the Group received dividends of US$238 million from Cerrejón, reducing completion proceeds, net of expected transaction costs, and the value of the Group's investment in Cerrejón to US$46 million as at 31 December 2021.\n\n(4) Predominantly comprises divisional activities and ceased operations.\n\n(5) Total Coal statutory result revenue excludes US$ nil (H1 FY21: US$63 million) revenue related to Cerrejón.

A new office has been opened in Toronto for exploration and business development, and expenditure on minerals exploration in the December 2021 half year increased 28 per cent to US$110 million. Work continues on existing projects, joint ventures and farm-ins as well as leveraging technology to both look deeper in mature exploration jurisdictions and delineate new high potential search spaces globally. We have continued to add to our early stage options in future facing commodities. Greenfield minerals exploration is being undertaken on advancing copper targets in Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Canada, Australia and the south-west United States. Nickel targets are also being advanced in Canada and Australia. Specifically in copper, we are testing targets with drilling in Chile, Ecuador, the United States and Australia.\n\nIn October 2021, BHP executed its farm-in agreement for the early-stage prospective Elliott copper project covering 7,200 km2 in the Northern Territory, Australia. Under the terms of the agreement, BHP can earn up to 75 per cent interest in Elliott by spending up to A$25 million over 10 years.\n\nBHP is continuing resource definition drilling at Oak Dam, after commencing the program in May 2021.\n\nIn December 2021, BHP announced it would not increase or extend its offer to acquire Noront Resources. BHP is committed to its strict capital allocation framework and while the Eagle’s Nest deposit is a promising resource, we do not see adequate long-term value for BHP shareholders.\n\nIn December 2021, BHP advanced its early-stage nickel interests by investing in the Kabanga Nickel Project (Kabanga), a high-quality nickel sulphide deposit in Tanzania. Kabanga is a joint venture between Kabanga Nickel Limited (84 per cent interest) and the Government of Tanzania (16 per cent interest).\n\nGroup and unallocated items\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for Group and unallocated items increased by US$290 million to US$396 million in the December 2021 half year primarily due to recovery of higher freight costs caused by movements in the freight index on consecutive voyage charter (CVC) voyages of US$172 million and lower demurrage costs related to China’s coal import restrictions.\n\nNickel West’s Underlying EBITDA decreased by US$3 million to US$118 million in the December 2021 half year. This reflects lower volumes and higher maintenance costs following planned maintenance at the Kalgoorlie Smelter, Kwinana Refinery and the Leinster and Kambalda concentrators in the September 2021 quarter, and planned asset integrity work to support operational stability completed in the December 2021 quarter. This was largely offset by higher prices and favourable exchange rate movements.\n\n 26\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nDiscontinued Operations – Petroleum\n\nIn November 2021, BHP signed a binding Share Sale Agreement for the proposed merger of BHP’s oil and gas portfolio with Woodside to create a global top 10 independent energy company by production. On completion of the merger, Woodside will acquire BHP Petroleum in exchange for new Woodside shares. Completion is subject to satisfaction of conditions precedent including regulatory and competition authority approvals and approval by Woodside’s shareholders. The process remains on track and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission confirmed in December 2021 that it will not oppose the transaction. The Woodside shareholder meeting to vote on the merger as well as completion of the merger remains targeted for the June 2022 quarter. In addition to its primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange, Woodside is pursuing a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange and a listing of American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange. The effective date of the merger is 1 July 2021. The half-year financial results have been prepared on the basis that BHP Petroleum is a discontinued operation.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for the December 2021 half year increased by US$2.1 billion to US$ 2.9 billion.\n\nUS$M\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for the half year 793 ended 31 December 2020\n\nBHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\n          Net price impact\n\nChange in volumes\n\nChange in controllable cash costs\n\n1,767 Higher average realised prices:\n\nCrude and condensate oil US$73.62/bbl (H1 FY21: US$41.24/bbl); Natural gas US$5.78/Mscf (H1 FY21: US$3.83/Mscf);\n\nLNG US$15.10/Mscf (H1 FY21: US$4.45/Mscf).\n\n170 Higher seasonal gas demand at Bass Strait, increased volumes from Ruby following first production in May 2021 and lower impact from weather events in the Gulf of Mexico partially offset by natural field decline across the portfolio.\n\n52 Increased maintenance and integrity activity in Trinidad and Tobago and the impact of expensing the Wasabi-1 well, were more than offset by the impact from expensing the Broadside-1 well and seismic costs in the Gulf of Mexico and Trinidad and Tobago in the prior period.\n\n         Ceased and sold operations 3 Change in other costs:\n\nExchange rates 40 Inflation (15)\n\n      Other\n\n108 Other includes the contingent consideration proceeds from the Scarborough divestment in 2016 (payable upon FID which was announced in November 2021) and tax barrel adjustments at Trinidad and Tobago, partially offset by the revaluation loss of embedded derivatives in the Trinidad and Tobago gas contract of US$32 million (H1 FY21: US$1 million loss) and other items.\n\n   Underlying EBITDA for the half year 2,918 ended 31 December 2021\n\nPetroleum unit costs increased by two per cent to US$10.51 per barrel of oil equivalent primarily driven by an increase in price-linked costs and increased maintenance and integrity activity in Trinidad and Tobago.

The approved capital expenditure represents BHP’s 26.5 per cent participating interest in Phase 1 of the upstream development. Final investment decisions have also been made by Woodside and the Scarborough Joint Venture.\n\nIn the December 2021 quarter, we completed the Ruby project in Trinidad and Tobago. The project was completed on schedule and within budget, and the Ruby field is currently producing both oil and gas.\n\nThe Mad Dog Phase 2 project’s semi-submersible platform, Argos, was towed to final location in the US Gulf of Mexico and moored. Offshore execution of construction and commissioning is in progress. First production from Mad Dog Phase 2 is expected from the middle of the 2022 calendar year.\n\nIn December 2021, we reached a commercial milestone for the Trion project in Mexico with the filing of a Declaration of Commerciality with the National Hydrocarbons Commission. As announced in August 2021, we have moved Trion into the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) phase and work is progressing to plan. Studies are underway, focused on completion of the engineering, commercial arrangements and execution planning required to progress readiness for a Final Investment Decision from the middle of the 2022 calendar year.\n\nPetroleum exploration\n\nPetroleum exploration expenditure for the December 2021 half year was US$243 million, of which US$112 million was expensed. An approximately US$540 million exploration and appraisal program is being executed for the 2022 financial year.\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, the Calypso appraisal drilling programme concluded on 20 December 2021. All wells encountered hydrocarbons. Bongos-3 confirmed volumes downdip of prior penetrations and Bongos-4 established volumes in a new segment. The well results are currently under evaluation and will be incorporated into the development plan.\n\nIn the central Gulf of Mexico, the Wasabi-1 well encountered a mechanical difficulty and was plugged and abandoned on 13 November 2021. Wasabi-2 (GC124-002) was spud on 17 November 2021 and drilling operations continue.\n\nIn Barbados, a 3D seismic survey was acquired in November 2021 over a portion of the Bimshire and Carlisle Bay blocks(ix). Processed data is expected to be delivered in the middle of the 2022 calendar year.\n\nBHP has acquired interests in offshore exploration blocks in the Red Sea in Egypt. In December 2021, the Minister of Energy in Egypt signed the Deed of Assignment for Red Sea Block 1, finalising the assignment of a 45 per cent participating interest from Chevron to BHP.

These statements discuss future expectations concerning the results of assets or financial conditions, or provide other forward-looking information.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are based on the information available as at the date of this release and are not guarantees or predictions of future performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements contained in this release. BHP cautions against reliance on any forward- looking statements or guidance, particularly in light of the current economic climate and the significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption arising in connection with COVID-19.\n\nFor example, our future revenues from our assets, projects or mines described in this release will be based, in part, upon the market price of the minerals, metals or petroleum produced, which may vary significantly from current levels. These variations, if materially adverse, may affect the timing or the feasibility of the development of a particular project, the expansion of certain facilities or mines, or the continuation of existing assets.\n\nOther factors that may affect the actual construction or production commencement dates, costs or production output and anticipated lives of assets, mines or facilities include our ability to profitably produce and transport the minerals, petroleum and/or metals extracted to applicable markets; the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the market prices of the minerals, petroleum or metals we produce; activities of government authorities in the countries where we sell our products and in the countries where we are exploring or developing projects, facilities or mines, including increases in taxes; changes in environmental and other regulations, the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business; political uncertainty; labour unrest; and other factors identified in the risk factors discussed in BHP’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‘SEC’) (including in Annual Reports on Form 20-F) which are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\n\nExcept as required by applicable regulations or by law, BHP does not undertake to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.\n\nPast performance cannot be relied on as a guide to future performance.\n\nNo offer of securities\n\nNothing in this release should be construed as either an offer, or a solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell BHP securities in any jurisdiction, or be treated or relied upon as a recommendation or advice by BHP.\n\nReliance on third party information\n\nThe views expressed in this release contain information that has been derived from publicly available sources that have not been independently verified. No representation or warranty is made as to the accuracy, completeness or reliability of the information. This release should not be relied upon as a recommendation or forecast by BHP.\n\nNo financial or investment advice – South Africa\n\nBHP does not provide any financial or investment 'advice' as that term is defined in the South African Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 37 of 2002, and we strongly recommend that you seek professional advice.\n\n  30\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nBHP and its subsidiaries\n\nIn this release, the terms ‘BHP’, the ‘Company, the ‘Group’, ‘BHP Group’, ‘our business’, ‘organisation’, ‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’ and ourselves’ refer to BHP Group Limited, BHP Group Plc and, except where the context otherwise requires, the respective subsidiaries as defined in note 30 ‘Subsidiaries’ in section 3.1 of BHP’s 30 June 2021 Annual Report and Form 20-F. Those terms do not include non-operated assets.\n\nThis release covers BHP’s assets (including those under exploration, projects in development or execution phases, sites and closed operations) that have been wholly owned and/or operated by BHP and that have been owned as a joint venture(1) operated by BHP (referred to in this release as ‘operated assets’ or ‘operations’) during the period from 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2021. Our functions are also included.\n\nBHP also holds interests in assets that are owned as a joint venture but not operated by BHP (referred to in this release as ‘non-operated joint ventures’ or ‘non-operated assets’). Our non-operated assets include Antamina, Samarco, Atlantis, Mad Dog, Bass Strait and North West Shelf. Notwithstanding that this release may include production, financial and other information from non-operated assets, non-operated assets are not included in the BHP Group and, as a result, statements regarding our operations, assets and values apply only to our operated assets unless stated otherwise.\n\n(1) References in this release to a ‘joint venture’ are used for convenience to collectively describe assets that are not wholly owned by BHP. Such references are not intended to characterise the legal relationship between the owners of the asset.\n\n31\n\nBHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\n News release\n\nFurther information on BHP can be found at: bhp.com Authorised for lodgement by:\n\nThe Board of BHP Group Limited\n\nMedia Relations\n\nEmail: media.relations@bhp.com Australia and Asia\n\nGabrielle Notley\n\nTel: +61 3 9609 3830 Mobile: +61 411 071 715\n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\n\nNeil Burrows\n\nTel: +44 20 7802 7484 Mobile: +44 7786 661 683\n\nAmericas\n\nJudy Dane\n\nTel: +1 713 961 8283 Mobile: +1 713 299 5342\n\nInvestor Relations\n\nEmail: investor.relations@bhp.com Australia and Asia\n\nDinesh Bishop\n\nMobile: +61 407 033 909\n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\n\nJames Bell\n\nTel: +44 20 7802 7144 Mobile: +44 7961 636 432\n\n    BHP Group Limited ABN 49 004 028 077\n\nLEI WZE1WSENV6JSZFK0JC28\n\nRegistered in Australia\n\nRegistered Office: Level 18, 171 Collins Street Melbourne Victoria 3000 Australia\n\nTel +61 1300 55 4757 Fax +61 3 9609 3015\n\nMembers of the BHP Group which is headquartered in Australia\n\nFollow us on social media\n\n32\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  BHP\n\nFinancial Report\n\nHalf year ended 31 December 2021\n\n33\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nFinancial Report\n\nContents\n\nHalf Year Financial Statements Page\n\nConsolidated Income Statement for the half year ended 31 December 2021 35 Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the half year ended 31 December 2021 35 Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2021 36 Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the half year ended 31 December 2021 37 Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the half year ended 31 December 2021 38 Notes to the Financial Statements 39\n\n1.

31 December 2021\n\n Notes to the Financial Statements\n\n1. Basis of preparation\n\nThis general purpose Financial Report for the half year ended 31 December 2021 is unaudited and has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and AASB 134 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ as issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as applicable to interim financial reporting.\n\nSegment Reporting disclosures from IAS 34/AASB 134 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ have been disclosed within the Segment summary on page 19 outside of this Financial Report.\n\nThe half year Financial Statements represent a ‘condensed set of Financial Statements’ as referred to in the UK Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules issued by the Financial Conduct Authority. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information required for a full annual report and are to be read in conjunction with the most recent annual financial report. The comparative figures for the financial year ended 30 June 2021 are not the statutory accounts of the Group for that financial year. Those accounts, which were prepared under IFRS, have been reported on by the Company's auditor and delivered to the registrar of companies. The auditor has reported on those accounts; the report was unqualified, did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditors drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and did not contain statements under Section 498 (2) or (3) of the UK Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe half year Financial Statements have been prepared on a basis of accounting policies and methods of computation consistent with those applied in the 30 June 2021 annual Financial Statements contained within the Annual Report of the Group. A number of accounting standards and interpretations, have been issued, and will be applicable in future periods. While these remain subject to ongoing assessment, no significant impacts have been identified to date. These standards have not been applied in the preparation of these half year Financial Statements.\n\nComparative periods have been adjusted for the effects of applying IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’ to the Group’s Petroleum business and to disclose them on the same basis as the current period figures.\n\nAll amounts are expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated. The Group’s presentation currency and the functional currency of the majority of its operations is US dollars as this is the principal currency of the economic environment in which it operates. Amounts in this Financial Report have, unless otherwise indicated, been rounded to the nearest million dollars.\n\nThe directors have made an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for the 12 months from the date of this report and consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the half year Financial Statements.\n\n2. Exceptional items\n\nExceptional items are those gains or losses where their nature, including the expected frequency of the events giving rise to them, and impact is considered material to the Financial Statements. Such items included within the Group’s profit for the half year from continuing operations are detailed below. Exceptional items attributable to discontinued operations are detailed in note 11 ‘Discontinued operations and Assets and liabilities held for sale’.\n\n    Gross Tax US$M US$M\n\nSamarco dam failure\n\nImpairment of US deferred tax assets\n\nTotal (822) (422)\n\nNet US$M\n\n(821)\n\n(423)\n\n(1,244)\n\n− (1,244)\n\nHalf year ended 31 December 2021\n\nExceptional items by category\n\n    (822) 1 − (423)\n\n        Attributable to non-controlling interests Attributable to BHP shareholders\n\n− − (822) (422)\n\n  39\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nFinancial Report\n\nSamarco Mineração SA (Samarco) dam failure\n\nThe loss of US$821 million (after tax) related to the Samarco dam failure in November 2015 comprises the following:\n\nHalf year ended 31 December 2021 US$M\n\nExpenses excluding net finance costs:\n\nCosts incurred directly by BHP Brasil and other BHP entities in relation to the Samarco dam failure (27)\n\nLoss from equity accounted investments, related impairments and expenses:\n\nSamarco impairment expense − Samarco Germano dam decommissioning 49 Samarco dam failure provision (539) Fair value change on forward exchange derivatives (212)\n\nNet finance costs (93) Income tax benefit 1 Total (1) (821)\n\n(1) Refer to note 10 ‘Significant events – Samarco dam failure’ for further information.\n\nImpairment of US deferred tax assets\n\nThe Group recognised an impairment charge of US$423 million (after tax) in relation to deferred tax assets where the recoverability has historically been reliant on Petroleum earnings in the same tax group. On 22 November 2021, the Group and Woodside Petroleum Ltd (‘Woodside’) signed a binding share sale agreement (SSA) for the merger of the Group’s oil and gas portfolio with Woodside (‘proposed merger’), and while these tax assets will remain with the Group after the expected completion of the proposed merger, the impairment charge reflects the status of the Petroleum business divestment and the extent of other currently forecast future earnings against which the assets can be recovered.\n\nThe exceptional items relating to the half year ended 31 December 2020 and the year ended 30 June 2021 are detailed below.\n\n                   Half year ended 31 December 2020 Gross Tax Restated US$M US$M Exceptional items by category\n\nSamarco dam failure\n\nNet US$M\n\n(377)\n\n(191) (1,574) (2,142) (10) (2,132)\n\nNet US$M\n\n(1,158) (361) (2,174) (1,787) (5,480) (24) (5,456)\n\n    COVID-19 related costs\n\nImpairment of Energy coal assets Total\n\nAttributable to non-controlling interests Attributable to BHP shareholders\n\nYear ended 30 June 2021 Restated\n\nExceptional items by category\n\nSamarco dam failure\n\nCOVID-19 related costs\n\nImpairment of Energy coal assets Impairment of Potash assets\n\nTotal\n\nAttributable to non-controlling interests Attributable to BHP shareholders\n\n(358) (19) (267) 76 (927) (647)\n\n    (1,552) (590) (15) 5 (1,537) (595)\n\nGross Tax US$M US$M\n\n(1,087) (71) (499) 138 (1,523) (651) (1,314) (473) (4,423) (1,057) (34) 10 (4,389) (1,067)\n\n                        40\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n3.

The transaction was first announced on 28 June 2021 for a total cash consideration of US$294 million with an effective economic date of 31 December 2020. The purchase price was subject to adjustments at transaction completion, including for dividends paid by Cerrejón to the Group during the period from signing to completion. At 31 December 2021, the Group's investment in Cerrejón continued to be classified as 'Assets held for sale' and measured at fair value in line with the divestment consideration. During the half year ended 31 December 2021, the Group received dividends of US$238 million from Cerrejón, reducing completion proceeds, net of expected transaction costs, and the value of the Group's investment in Cerrejón to US$46 million as at 31 December 2021.

Effective from 31 January 2022, the aggregate of the weighted average number of ordinary shares of only BHP Group Limited will be considered in the computation of basic earnings per share. Refer to notes 9 ‘Share capital’ and 12 ‘Subsequent events’ for details on Unification.\n\n(3) For the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the effect of 11 million dilutive shares has been taken into account for the half year ended 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: 12 million shares; 30 June 2021: 11 million shares). The Group’s only potential dilutive ordinary shares are share awards granted under employee share ownership plans.

Subsequent to the half year, on 15 February 2022, BHP Group Limited determined an interim ordinary dividend of 150 US cents per share (US$7,593 million), which will be paid on 28 March 2022. Prior to Unification, an ordinary dividend was determined by both BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc (31 December 2020: interim dividend of 101 US cents per share – US$5,107 million; 30 June 2021: final dividend of 200 US cents per share – US$10,114 million).\n\nBHP Group Limited dividends for all periods presented are, or will be, fully franked based on a tax rate of 30 per cent.\n\n44\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n                   Contractual cash flows\n\nSolely principal and interest Solely principal and interest Solely principal and interest Other\n\nBusiness model\n\nHold in order to collect contractual cash flows\n\nHold in order to collect contractual cash flows and sell Hold in order to sell\n\nAny of those mentioned above\n\nCategory\n\nAmortised cost\n\nFair value through other comprehensive income Fair value through profit or loss\n\nFair value through profit or loss\n\nBHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\n 8. Financial risk management – Fair values\n\nAll financial assets and financial liabilities, other than derivatives and trade receivables, are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration paid or received, net of transaction costs as appropriate. Financial assets are initially recognised on their trade date.\n\nFinancial assets are subsequently carried at fair value or amortised cost based on:\n\n‒ the Group’s purpose, or business model, for holding the financial asset;\n\n‒ whether the financial asset’s contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nThe resulting Financial Statements classifications of financial assets can be summarised as follows:\n\n                  Solely principal and interest refers to the Group receiving returns only for the time value of money and the credit risk of the counterparty for financial assets held. The main exceptions for the Group are provisionally priced receivables and derivatives which are measured at fair value through the income statement under IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’.\n\nThe Group has the intention of collecting payment directly from its customers in most cases, however the Group also participates in receivables financing programs in respect of selected customers. Receivables in these portfolios which are classified as ‘hold in order to sell’, are provisionally priced receivables and are therefore held at fair value through profit or loss prior to sale to the financial institution.\n\nWith the exception of derivative contracts and provisionally priced trade payables, the Group’s financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\nThe Group may in addition elect to designate certain financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or to apply hedge accounting where they are not mandatorily held at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.\n\nFair value measurement\n\nThe carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is principally calculated based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for these financial assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as unquoted prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Group’s views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such estimates.\n\nThe inputs used in fair value calculations are determined by the relevant segment or function. The functions support the assets and operate under a defined set of accountabilities authorised by the Executive Leadership Team. Movements in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities may be recognised through the income statement or in other comprehensive income.\n\nFor financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the Group uses the following to categorise the method used based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\n     IFRS 13 Fair value hierarchy Level 1\n\n       Level 2 Level 3\n\n   Valuation method Based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active\n\nmarkets for identical financial assets and liabilities.\n\n  Based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the financial asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as unquoted prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n\nBased on inputs not observable in the market using appropriate valuation models, including discounted cash flow modelling.\n\n  45\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nFinancial Report\n\nThe financial assets and liabilities are presented by class in the following table at their carrying values, which generally approximate to fair value. In the case of US$3,018 million (30 June 2021: US$3,018 million) of fixed rate debt not swapped to floating rate, the fair value at 31 December 2021 was US$3,945 million (30 June 2021: US$4,052 million). The fair value is determined using a method that can be categorised as Level 2 and uses inputs based on benchmark interest rates, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments categorised as Level 3 uses inputs primarily based on commodity prices and operational variables.\n\nFor financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period. There were no transfers between categories during the period.\n\n Financial assets and liabilities\n\nCurrent cross currency and interest rate swaps(2) Current other derivative contracts(3)\n\nCurrent other financial assets(4)\n\nCurrent other investments(5)\n\nNon-current cross currency and interest rate swaps(2) Non-current other derivative contracts(3)\n\nNon-current other financial assets(4)\n\nNon-current investment in shares\n\nNon-current other investments(5) Total other financial assets\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\nTrade and other receivables(6) Provisionally priced trade receivables Total financial assets\n\nNon-financial assets Total assets\n\nCurrent cross currency and interest rate swaps(2) Current other derivative contracts(3)\n\nCurrent other financial liabilities(7)\n\nNon-current cross currency and interest rate swaps(2) Non-current other derivative contracts(3)\n\nNon-current other financial liabilities(7) Total other financial liabilities\n\nTrade and other payables(8) Provisionally priced trade payables Bank loans(9)\n\nNotes and debentures(9) Lease liabilities\n\nOther(9)\n\nTotal financial liabilities Non-financial liabilities Total liabilities\n\nIFRS 13\n\nFair value 31 Dec hierarchy 2021\n\n     Level(1) IFRS 9 Classification\n\n2 Fair value through profit or loss 2,3 Fair value through profit or loss 3 Fair value through profit or loss 1,2 Fair value through profit or loss 2 Fair value through profit or loss 2,3 Fair value through profit or loss 3 Fair value through profit or loss\n\n3 Fair value through other comprehensive income 1,2 Fair value through profit or loss\n\nAmortised cost\n\nAmortised cost\n\n2 Fair value through profit or loss\n\n2 Fair value through profit or loss 2,3 Fair value through profit or loss\n\nAmortised cost\n\n2 Fair value through profit or loss\n\n2,3 Fair value through profit or loss Amortised cost\n\nAmortised cost\n\n2 Fair value through profit or loss\n\nAmortised cost Amortised cost\n\nAmortised cost\n\n30 June 2021 US$M US$M 30 20 78 207 134 − 22 3 802 1,123 − 152 131 − 6 31 276 304 1,479 1,840 12,366 15,246 1,847 2,363 2,854 3,547 18,546 22,996 87,179 85,931 105,725 108,927\n\n113 − 66 52 68 78\n\n757 586 57 − 499 560 1,560 1,276 3,813 6,277 707 574 2,195 2,260 13,707 14,769 3,016 3,896 33 58 25,031 29,110 25,772 24,212 50,803 53,322\n\n                                                     (1) All of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities recognised at fair value were valued using market observable inputs categorised as Level 2 unless specified otherwise in the following footnotes.\n\n(2) Cross currency and interest rate swaps are valued using market data including interest rate curves (which include the base LIBOR rate and swap rates) and foreign exchange rates.

Share capital\n\nAt 31 December 2021, BHP Group Limited had 2,950 million ordinary shares on issue and held by the public and BHP Group Plc had 2,112 million ordinary shares on issue and held by the public. No shares in BHP Group Limited were held by BHP Group Plc at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: nil; 30 June 2021: nil).\n\nDuring August 2021, BHP Group Limited issued 4,400,000 fully paid ordinary shares to the BHP Billiton Limited Employee Equity Trust at A$52.99 per share, to satisfy the vesting of employee share awards and related dividend equivalent entitlements under those employee share plans.\n\nOn 3 September 2021, BHP Group Plc acquired by way of gift from J.P. Morgan Limited the 50,000 issued 5.5 per cent cumulative preference shares of £1.00, in the capital of BHP Group Plc. The preference shares were held by BHP Group Plc at 31 December 2021 and cancelled on 31 January 2022.\n\nOn 2 December 2021, BHP announced a final Board decision to unify BHP’s corporate structure under its existing Australian parent company, BHP Group Limited which was approved on 20 January 2022 by BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc shareholders. On 31 January 2022, 2,112,071,796 fully paid ordinary shares in BHP Group Limited were issued to BHP Group Plc shareholders in a one for one exchange of their BHP Group Plc ordinary shares, resulting in BHP Group Limited becoming the sole parent company of the BHP Group with a single set of shareholders.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, BHP Group Plc had one Special Voting share on issue and BHP Group Limited had one Special Voting share and one DLC dividend share on issue to facilitate operation of the Group’s dual listed structure. In connection with Unification, these shares were bought back for nominal value in January 2022 and subsequently cancelled.\n\n10. Significant events – Samarco dam failure\n\nAs a result of the Samarco dam failure on 5 November 2015, BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda (BHP Brasil) and other Group entities continue to incur costs and maintain liabilities for future costs. The information presented in this note should be read in conjunction with section 1.15 ‘Samarco’ and Financial Statements note 4 ‘Significant events – Samarco dam failure’ in the 30 June 2021 Annual Report.\n\nThe financial impacts of the Samarco dam failure on the Group’s income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement for the half year ended 31 December 2021 are shown below and have been treated as an exceptional item.\n\nBHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\n     Financial impacts of Samarco dam failure\n\nIncome statement\n\nOther income(1)\n\nExpenses excluding net finance costs:\n\nCosts incurred directly by BHP Brasil and other BHP entities in relation to the Samarco dam\n\nfailure(2) (27) Loss from equity accounted investments, related impairments and expenses:\n\n(19)\n\n(90) − (300) 92 (317) (41) (358) (19) (377)\n\n6 73 − (114) (35)\n\nHalf year Half year ended ended 31 Dec 31 Dec 2021 2020 US$M US$M\n\n− −\n\nYear ended 30 June 2021 US$M\n\n34\n\n(46)\n\n(111) (15) (1,000) 136 (1,002) (85) (1,087) (71) (1,158)\n\n(5) 136 (71) (741) (681)\n\n    Samarco impairment expense(3)\n\nSamarco Germano dam decommissioning(4) Samarco dam failure provision(5)\n\nFair value change on forward exchange derivatives(6)\n\nLoss from operations\n\nNet finance costs(7)\n\nLoss before taxation\n\nIncome tax benefit/(expense)(8) Loss after taxation\n\nBalance sheet movement\n\nTrade and other payables Derivatives\n\nTax liabilities\n\nProvisions\n\nNet liabilities\n\n− 49 (539) (212) (729) (93) (822) 1 (821)\n\n3 (202) 1 (327) (525)\n\n                      47\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nFinancial Report\n\n      Half year ended 31 Dec 2021 US$M\n\nHalf year ended 31 Dec 2020 US$M\n\nYear ended 30 June 2021 US$M\n\n        Cash flow statement\n\nLoss before taxation\n\nAdjustments for:\n\nSamarco impairment expense(3)\n\nSamarco Germano dam decommissioning(4)\n\nSamarco dam failure provision(5)\n\nFair value change on forward exchange derivatives(6) Settlements of cash management related instruments\n\nNet finance costs(7)\n\nChanges in assets and liabilities:\n\nTrade and other payables\n\nNet operating cash flows\n\nNet investment and funding of equity accounted investments(9) Net investing cash flows\n\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n\n(1) Proceeds from insurance settlements.\n\n(2) Includes legal and advisor costs incurred.\n\n− (49) 539 212 (10) 93\n\n(3)\n\n(822)\n\n(40) (256) (256) (296)\n\n90 − 300 (92)\n\n− 41\n\n(6)\n\n(358)\n\n(25) (317) (317) (342)\n\n111 15 1,000 (136)\n\n− 85\n\n5\n\n(1,087)\n\n(7) (470) (470) (477)\n\n                                 (3) Impairment expense from working capital funding provided during the period.\n\n(4) US$25 million (31 December 2020: US$12 million; 30 June 2021: US$6 million) change in estimate and US$24 million (31 December 2020: US$(12) million; 30 June 2021: US$(21) million) exchange translation.\n\n(5) US$(806) million (31 December 2020: US$(205) million; 30 June 2021: US$(842) million) change in estimate and US$267 million (31 December 2020: US$(95) million; 30 June 2021: US$(158) million) exchange translation.\n\n(6) During FY2021 the Group entered into forward exchange contracts to limit the Brazilian reais exposure on the dam failure provisions.

Key Programs include those for financial assistance and compensation of impacted persons, including fisherfolk impacted by the dam failure, and those for remediation of impacted areas and resettlement of impacted communities. A committee (Interfederative Committee) comprising representatives from the Brazilian Federal and State Governments, local municipalities, environmental agencies, impacted communities and Public Defence Office oversees the activities of the Fundação Renova in order to monitor, guide and assess the progress of actions agreed in the Framework Agreement.\n\nIn addition, the 12th Federal Court is supervising the work of the Fundação Renova and the Court’s decisions relating to financial compensation for impacted persons have been considered in the Samarco dam failure provision, including a ruling in October 2021 that expanded the scope of individuals eligible for compensation and the amount of damages for certain categories of impacted individuals. The provision may be impacted in future reporting periods as a result of appeals and motions for clarification on certain Court decisions that remain outstanding.\n\nTo the extent that Samarco does not meet its funding obligations during the 15 year term of the Framework Agreement, each of BHP Brasil and Vale has funding obligations under the Framework Agreement in proportion to its 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco.\n\nSamarco began to gradually recommence operations in December 2020, however, there remains uncertainty regarding Samarco’s future cash flow generation and the outcome of the Judicial Reorganisation (outlined below). In light of these uncertainties and based on currently available information, BHP Brasil’s provision for its obligations under the Framework Agreement Programs is US$2.9 billion before tax and after discounting at 31 December 2021 (30 June 2021: US$2.6 billion).\n\nUnder a Governance Agreement ratified on 8 August 2018, BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale were to establish a process to renegotiate the Programs over two years to progress settlement of the R$155 billion (approximately US$28 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim (described below). Pre-requisites established in the Governance Agreement, for re-negotiation of the Framework Agreement were not implemented during the two year period and on 30 September 2020, Brazilian Federal and State prosecutors and public defenders filed a request for the immediate resumption of the R$155 billion (approximately US$28 billion) claim, which was suspended for two years from the date of ratification of the Governance Agreement. The claim was suspended again after the parties to the claim agreed to continue the suspension on 19 March 2021. Formal suspension of the claim ceased on 10 December 2021, however no further rulings have been made and BHP Brasil, Samarco, Vale and Federal and State prosecutors have been engaging in negotiations to seek a definitive and substantive settlement of the obligations under the Framework Agreement and the R$155 billion (approximately US$28 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim.\n\nIt is not possible to provide a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential settlement outcomes and there is a risk that a negotiated outcome may be materially higher than amounts currently reflected in the Samarco dam failure provision. Until any revisions to the Programs are agreed, Fundação Renova will continue to implement the Programs in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement and the Governance Agreement.\n\nBHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale are required to maintain security of an amount equal to the Fundação Renova’s annual budget up to a limit of R$2.2 billion (approximately US$395 million). At 31 December 2021, the security comprised R$1.3 billion (approximately US$235 million) in insurance bonds and a charge of R$800 million (approximately US$145 million) over Samarco’s assets. A further R$100 million (approximately US$20 million) in liquid assets previously maintained as security was released during FY2020 for COVID-19 related response efforts in Brazil.\n\nSamarco Germano dam decommissioning\n\nSamarco is currently progressing plans for the accelerated decommissioning of its upstream tailings dams (the Germano dam complex). Given the uncertainties surrounding Samarco’s future cash flow generation, BHP Brasil’s provision for a 50 per cent share of the expected Germano decommissioning costs is US$191 million at 31 December 2021 (30 June 2021: US$232 million). The decommissioning is at an early stage and as a result, further engineering work and required validation by Brazilian authorities could lead to changes to estimates in future reporting periods.\n\n49\n\nBHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nFinancial Report\n\nContingent liabilities\n\nThe following matters are disclosed as contingent liabilities and given the status of proceedings it is not possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures for BHP, unless otherwise stated. Ultimately, all the legal matters disclosed as contingent liabilities could have a material adverse impact on BHP’s business, competitive position, cash flows, prospects, liquidity and shareholder returns.\n\nFederal Public Prosecution Office claim\n\nBHP Brasil is among the defendants named in a claim brought by the Federal Public Prosecution Office on 3 May 2016, seeking R$155 billion (approximately US$28 billion) for reparation, compensation and moral damages in relation to the Samarco dam failure.\n\nThe 12th Federal Court previously suspended the Federal Public Prosecution Office claim, including a R$7.7 billion (approximately US$1.4 billion) injunction request. On 30 September 2020, Brazilian Federal and State prosecutors and public defenders filed a request for the immediate resumption of the R$155 billion (approximately US$28 billion) claim, which was suspended for two years from the date of ratification of the Governance Agreement. The claim was suspended again after the parties to the claim agreed to continue the suspension on 19 March 2021. Formal suspension of the claim ceased on 10 December 2021, however no further rulings been made and BHP Brasil, Samarco, Vale and Federal and State prosecutors have been engaging in negotiations to seek a definitive and substantive settlement of the obligations under the Framework Agreement and the R$155 billion (approximately US$28 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim.\n\nIt is not possible to provide a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential settlement outcomes and there is a risk that a negotiated outcome may be materially higher than amounts currently reflected in the Samarco dam failure provision.\n\nAustralian class action complaints\n\nBHP Group Ltd is named as a defendant in a shareholder class action filed in the Federal Court of Australia on behalf of persons who acquired shares in BHP Group Ltd on the Australian Securities Exchange or shares in BHP Group Plc on the London Stock Exchange and Johannesburg Stock Exchange in periods prior to the Samarco dam failure. The amount of damages sought is unspecified.\n\nUnited Kingdom group action complaint\n\nBHP Group Plc and BHP Group Ltd were named as defendants in group action claims for damages filed in the courts of England. These claims were filed on behalf of certain individuals, governments, businesses and communities in Brazil allegedly impacted by the Samarco dam failure. The amount of damages sought in these claims is unspecified. The complaint and a subsequent application for permission to appeal have been dismissed by the court, however an application by the claimants to reopen the proceedings was granted in July 2021, allowing the claimants to appeal previous dismissals of the claim. The appeal is scheduled to be heard in April 2022.\n\nCriminal charges\n\nThe Federal Prosecutors’ Office has filed criminal charges against BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale and certain employees and former employees of BHP Brasil (Affected Individuals) in the Federal Court of Ponte Nova, Minas Gerais. On 3 March 2017, BHP Brasil filed its preliminary defences. The Federal Court terminated the charges against eight of the Affected Individuals. The Federal Prosecutors’ Office has appealed seven of those decisions with hearings of the appeals still pending. BHP Brasil rejects outright the charges against the company and the Affected Individuals and will defend the charges and fully support each of the Affected Individuals in their defence of the charges.\n\nOther claims\n\nBHP Brasil is among the companies named as defendants in a number of legal proceedings initiated by individuals, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), corporations and governmental entities in Brazilian Federal and State courts following the Samarco dam failure. The other defendants include Vale, Samarco and Fundação Renova. The lawsuits include claims for compensation, environmental rehabilitation and violations of Brazilian environmental and other laws, among other matters. The lawsuits seek various remedies including rehabilitation costs, compensation to injured individuals and families of the deceased, recovery of personal and property losses, moral damages and injunctive relief. In addition, government inquiries and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have been commenced by numerous agencies of the Brazilian government and are ongoing.\n\n 50\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nBHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\nAdditional lawsuits and government investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure could be brought against BHP Brasil and possibly other BHP entities in Brazil or other jurisdictions.\n\nBHP insurance\n\nBHP has insurances for class action claims related to the Samarco dam failure made directly against BHP Brasil or other BHP entities. External insurers have been notified of the Samarco dam failure and the class actions referred to above. As at 31 December 2021, an insurance receivable has not been recognised for any potential recoveries in respect of ongoing matters.\n\nCommitments\n\nUnder the terms of the Samarco joint venture agreement, BHP Brasil does not have an existing obligation to fund Samarco, any funding provided by BHP Brasil during the year in respect of Fundação Renova or Germano dam decommissioning obligations will be offset against the Group’s provision for the Samarco dam failure.\n\nSamarco judicial reorganisation\n\nSamarco filed for Judicial Reorganisation (JR) in April 2021, with the Commercial Courts of Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil (JR Court), after multiple enforcement actions taken by certain creditors of Samarco. Samarco’s JR filing followed unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a debt restructure with certain financial creditors and multiple legal actions filed by those creditors which threatened Samarco’s operations. The JR is an insolvency proceeding with a means for Samarco to seek to restructure its financial debts and establish a sustainable financial position that allows Samarco to continue to rebuild its operations and strengthen its ability to meet its Fundação Renova funding obligations. Samarco’s operations are expected to continue during the JR and restructure process.\n\nAccording to the list of creditors filed with the JR Court by the Judicial Administrators (who are in charge of a first review of the list of creditors filed by Samarco), Fundação Renova’s funding obligations undertaken by Samarco are not subject to the JR, although some financial creditors of Samarco have objected to this position. Some such creditors filed challenges to the list of creditors filed by the Judicial Administrators, in order to, among other things, prevent Samarco from funding Fundação Renova. In December 2021, the 12th Federal Court granted BHP Brasil's request that Samarco be able to fund Fundação Renova obligations, overturning a temporary injunction against such funding previously granted by the state court in October 2021. BHP Brasil also obtained a preliminary injunction from the Superior Court supporting the jurisdiction of the 12th Federal Court, and not the state court, in this matter. It is expected that there will be continuing litigation from creditors against Samarco and its shareholders over the course of the JR proceeding, including with respect to the treatment of Samarco’s Fundação Renova-related obligations and attempts to pierce Samarco’s corporate veil to hold BHP Brasil and Vale liable for Samarco’s debts.\n\nThe JR is not expected to affect Samarco’s obligation or commitment to make full redress for the 2015 Fundão dam failure, and is not expected to impact Fundação Renova’s ability to undertake that remediation and compensation. It is not possible to determine the outcomes of the JR or estimate any impact that the reorganisation may have for BHP Brasil, including its share of the Samarco dam failure provisions.\n\n 51\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nFinancial Report\n\n   Key judgements and estimates\n\nJudgements\n\nThe outcomes of litigation are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgement has been applied in assessing the likely outcome of legal claims and determining which legal claims require recognition of a provision or disclosure of a contingent liability. The facts and circumstances relating to these cases are regularly evaluated in determining whether a provision for any specific claim is required.\n\nManagement have determined that a provision can only be recognised for obligations under the Framework Agreement and Samarco Germano dam decommissioning as at 31 December 2021. It is not yet possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures to BHP in connection to the contingent liabilities noted above, given their status.\n\nEstimates\n\nThe provisions for Samarco dam failure and Samarco Germano dam decommissioning currently reflect the estimated remaining costs to complete Programs under the Framework Agreement and estimated costs to complete the Germano dam decommissioning and require the use of significant judgements, estimates and assumptions. Based on current estimates, it is expected that approximately 90 per cent of remaining costs for Programs under the Framework Agreement will be incurred by December 2023.\n\nWhile the provisions have been measured based on information available as at 31 December 2021, likely changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods may lead to revisions to these estimates. However, it is currently not possible to determine what facts and circumstances may change, therefore the possible revisions in future reporting periods cannot be reliably measured.\n\nThe key estimates that may have a material impact upon the provisions in the next and future reporting periods include:\n\n• number of people eligible for financial assistance and compensation and the corresponding amount of expected compensation; and\n\n• costs to complete key infrastructure programs.\n\nThe provision may also be affected by factors including but not limited to:\n\n• resolution of existing and potential legal claims in Brazil and other jurisdictions, including the impact of ongoing settlement negotiations and outcome of the United Kingdom group action complaint;\n\n• potential changes in scope of work and funding amounts required under the Framework Agreement including the impact of the decisions of the Interfederative Committee along with further technical analysis and community participation required under the Governance Agreement and rulings made by the 12th Federal Court;\n\n• the outcome of ongoing negotiations with State and Federal Prosecutors, including review of Fundação Renova’s Programs as provided in the Governance Agreement;\n\n• actual costs incurred;\n\n• resolution of uncertainty in respect of the nature and extent of Samarco’s long term cash generation;\n\n• costs to complete the Germano dam decommissioning;\n\n• updates to discount and foreign exchange rates; and\n\n• the outcomes of Samarco’s JR.\n\nGiven these factors, future actual expenditures may differ from the amounts currently provided and changes to key assumptions and estimates could result in a material impact to the provision in the next and future reporting periods.\n\n 52\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nBHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\n11. Discontinued operations and Assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nOn 22 November 2021, the Group and Woodside signed a binding SSA for the merger of the Group’s oil and gas portfolio with Woodside. Woodside will acquire the entire share capital of BHP Petroleum International Pty Ltd (‘BHP Petroleum’) in exchange for new Woodside shares. On completion of the proposed merger, Woodside will issue new shares expected to comprise approximately 48 per cent of all Woodside shares (on a post-issue basis) as consideration for the acquisition of BHP Petroleum.\n\nThe proposed merger, which has an effective date of 1 July 2021, is subject to satisfaction of conditions precedent by 30 June 2022 or an agreed later date including shareholder, regulatory and other approvals. Prior to completion, the Group continues to control its Petroleum assets and carry on business in the normal course. As such, the Group continued to recognise its share of revenue, expenses, net finance costs and associated income tax expense related to the operation.\n\nOn completion, Woodside will make a cash payment to BHP in relation to cash dividends paid by Woodside between the effective date and completion. BHP will make a cash payment to Woodside for the net cash flow generated by BHP Petroleum between the effective date and completion (or, if that amount is negative, Woodside will make a cash payment to BHP).\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Petroleum business was classified as a disposal group held for sale and as a discontinued operation. The proposed merger is expected to be completed during the second half of FY2022.\n\nThe contribution of discontinued operations included within the Group’s profit and cash flows are detailed below:\n\n Income statement – Discontinued operations\n\nHalf year ended 31 Dec 2021 US$M Revenue 3,257\n\n        Other income\n\nExpenses excluding net finance costs\n\nLoss from equity accounted investments, related impairments and expenses Profit/(loss) from operations\n\nFinancial expenses\n\nFinancial income\n\nNet finance costs Profit/(loss) before taxation\n\nIncome tax expense\n\nRoyalty-related taxation (net of income tax benefit) Total taxation expense\n\nProfit/(loss) after taxation\n\nAttributable to non-controlling interests Attributable to BHP shareholders\n\nBasic earnings/(loss) per ordinary share (cents) Diluted earnings/(loss) per ordinary share (cents)\n\nHalf year ended 31 Dec 2020 US$M 1,595 172 20\n\nYear ended 30 June 2021 US$M 3,896\n\n130 (3,629) (6) 391\n\n(88) 6 (82) 309\n\n(545) 11 (534) (225) − (225)\n\n(4.5) (4.5)\n\n(1,391) (1,749) (1) (5) 2,037 (139)\n\n(46) (50) 1 2 (45) (48) 1,992 (187)\n\n(966) (16) (54) 11 (1,020) (5) 972 (192) − − 972 (192)\n\n19.2 (3.8) 19.2 (3.8)\n\n                                      The total comprehensive income attributable to BHP shareholders from discontinued operations was a gain of US$975 million (31 December 2020: loss of US$192 million; 30 June 2021: loss of US$231 million).\n\nThe conversion of options and share rights would decrease the loss per share for the half year ended 31 December 2020 and the year ended 30 June 2021, therefore its impact has been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.\n\n53\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nFinancial Report\n\nCash flows from Discontinued operations\n\nNet operating cash flows\n\nNet investing cash flows(1)\n\nNet financing cash flows(2)\n\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents from Discontinued operations\n\nHalf year ended 31 Dec 2021 US$M\n\n1,748 (544) (18)\n\n1,186\n\nHalf year ended 31 Dec 2020 US$M\n\n221 (980) (19) (778)\n\nYear ended 30 June 2021 US$M\n\n1,351 (1,520) (38) (207)\n\n               (1) Includes purchases of property, plant and equipment and capitalised exploration of US$687 million related to drilling and development expenditure (31 December 2020: US$512 million; 30 June 2021: US$1,020 million), investments in subsidiaries, operations and joint operations, net of cash of US$ nil (31 December 2020: US$482 million; 30 June 2021: US$480 million), proceeds from sale of assets of US$(145) million (31 December 2020: US$(41) million; 30 June 2021: US$(39) million) and other investing outflows of US$2 million (31 December 2020: US$27 million; 30 June 2021: US$59 million).\n\n(2) Represents net repayment of interest bearing liabilities of US$18 million (31 December 2020: US$19 million; 30 June 2021: US$38 million).\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale\n\nIn addition to the Group’s Petroleum business, the Group’s investment in Cerrejόn and interest in BHP Mitsui Coal (BMC) were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 December 2021.The assets and liabilities classified as current assets and liabilities held for sale are presented in the table below:\n\n   30 June 2021(1)\n\nTotal Total US$M US$M\n\n1,641 40 25 − 364 − 69 − 12,892 − 66 − 292 284 1,901 − 22 − 17,272 324\n\n1,116 17 528 − 22 − 420 − 4,875 − 56 − 547 − 7,564 17 9,708 307\n\n(1) On 11 January 2022 BHP completed the sale to Glencore of its 33.3 per cent interest in Cerrejón, a non-operated energy coal joint venture in Colombia. The transaction was first announced on 28 June 2021 for a total cash consideration of US$294 million with an effective economic date of 31 December 2020. The purchase price was subject to adjustments at transaction completion, including for dividends paid by Cerrejón to the Group during the period from signing to completion. At 31 December 2021, the Group's investment in Cerrejón continued to be classified as 'Assets held for sale' and measured at fair value in line with the divestment consideration. During the half year ended 31 December 2021, the Group received dividends of US$238 million from Cerrejón, reducing completion proceeds, net of expected transaction costs, and the value of the Group's investment in Cerrejón to US$46 million as at 31 December 2021. Valuations are based primarily on Level 3 inputs as defined in note 8 ‘Financial risk management’.\n\n(2) On 8 November 2021 the Group announced it has entered into a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement to divest its 80 per cent interest in BMC, an operated metallurgical coal joint venture in Queensland to Stanmore SMC Holdings Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Stanmore Resources Limited (Stanmore Resources) for cash consideration of up to US$1.35 billion.\n\nThe purchase price comprises US$1.1 billion cash on completion, US$100 million in cash six months after completion and the potential for up to US$150 million in a commodity price-linked earnout payable in calendar year 2024. Subject to the satisfaction of customary competition and regulatory requirements the transaction completion is expected to occur in the middle of the 2022 calendar year.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the assets and liabilities of BMC have been classified as ‘Assets held for sale’ and ‘Liabilities directly associated with the assets held for sale’. However BMC is not considered to meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation given its relative size to the Group and the Coal segment.\n\n31 Dec 2021\n\nPetroleum Cerrejόn(1) BMC(2) US$M US$M US$M\n\n           Assets\n\nTrade and other receivables\n\nOther financial assets\n\nInventories 278 Current tax assets\n\nProperty, plant and equipment\n\nIntangible assets\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method\n\nDeferred tax assets\n\nOther\n\nTotal assets\n\nLiabilities\n\nTrade and other payables\n\nInterest bearing liabilities\n\nOther financial liabilities\n\nTax payable\n\nProvisions 4,462 Deferred income\n\nDeferred tax liabilities\n\nTotal liabilities\n\nNet assets\n\n1,431 − 210 − − 25 − 86 59 − 10 11,699 − 1,193 66 − − 246 46 − 1,901 − − 18 − 4 15,698 46 1,528\n\n            953 − 163 257 − 271 22 − − 373 − 47 − 413 56 − − 536 − 11 6,659 − 905 9,039 46 623\n\n             54\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nExceptional items – Discontinued operations\n\nExceptional items are those gains or losses where their nature, including the expected frequency of the events giving rise to them, and amount is considered material to the financial statements.\n\nThere were no exceptional items related to discontinued operations for the half year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nExceptional items related to discontinued operations included within the Group’s profit for the half year ended 31 December 2020 and year ended 30 June 2021 are detailed below:\n\nGross Tax Net Half year ended 31 Dec 2020 US$M US$M US$M\n\nExceptional items by category\n\nCOVID-19 related costs (31) 3 (28)\n\nBHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2021\n\n             3 (28) − − − (31) 3 (28)\n\nGross Tax Net US$M US$M US$M\n\nImpairment of Potash assets(1)\n\nCOVID-19 related costs\n\nTotal (47)\n\nAttributable to non-controlling interests − − − Attributable to BHP shareholders (47) (270) (317)\n\n(1) The exceptional item reflects the impairment of tax losses originally expected to be recoverable against taxable profits from the Group’s Potash assets. The impairment is included in discontinued operations as the entity with the losses is expected to transfer to Woodside and therefore the losses will no longer be available to the Group.\n\n12. Subsequent events\n\nIn December 2021, BHP announced a final Board decision to unify BHP’s corporate structure under its existing Australian parent company, BHP Group Limited. Unification was completed on 31 January 2022. Refer note 9 ‘Share capital’ for details. Other than the expected transaction costs of approximately US$410 million (before tax), unification is not expected to impact the consolidated net assets of the Group.\n\nOther than the matters outlined elsewhere in this Financial Report, no matters or circumstances have arisen since the end of the half year that have significantly affected, or may significantly affect, the operations, results of operations or state of affairs of the Group in subsequent accounting periods.\n\nTotal (31)\n\n    Attributable to non-controlling interests Attributable to BHP shareholders\n\nYear ended 30 June 2021\n\nExceptional items by category\n\n          − (278) (278) (47) 8 (39) (270) (317)\n\n          55\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nFinancial Report\n\nDirectors’ Report\n\nThe Directors present their report together with the half year Financial Statements for the half year ended 31 December 2021 and the auditor’s review report thereon.\n\nReview of Operations\n\nA detailed review of the Group’s operated and non-operated assets, the results of those operations during the half year ended 31 December 2021 and likely future developments are given on pages 1 to 32. The Review of Operations has been incorporated into, and forms part of, this Directors’ Report.\n\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\n\nThe principal risks affecting the Group are described on pages 56 to 63 of the Group's Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2021 (a copy of which is available on the Group's website at www.bhp.com) and are grouped into the categories of risks listed below. Our principal risks may occur as a result of our activities globally, including in connection with our operated and non-operated assets, third parties engaged by BHP or through our value chain. Our principal risks, individually or collectively, could threaten our viability, strategy, business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity and reputation. They could also materially and adversely affect the health and safety of our people or members of the public, the environment, the communities in which we or our third-party partners operate, or the interests of our stakeholders leading to litigation (including class actions) or a loss of stakeholder and/or investor confidence. There are no material changes in those risk factors for the first six months of this financial year except to the extent described in the ‘Outlook’ section.\n\n• Operational events: Risks associated with operational events in connection with our activities globally.\n\n• Accessing key markets: Risks associated with market concentration and our ability to sell and deliver products into\n\nexisting and future key markets.\n\n• Optimising portfolio returns and managing commodity price movements: Risks associated with our ability to position our asset portfolio to generate returns and value for shareholders (including securing growth options in future facing commodities) and to manage adverse impacts of short- and long-term movements in commodity prices.\n\n• Significant social or environmental impacts: Risks associated with significant impacts of our operations on and contributions to communities and environments throughout the life cycle of our assets and across our value chain.\n\n• Low-carbon transition: Risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n• Adopting technologies and maintaining digital security: Risks associated with adopting and implementing new technologies, and maintaining the effectiveness of our existing digital landscape (including cyber defences) across our value chain.\n\n• Ethical misconduct: Risks associated with actual or alleged deviation from societal or business expectations of ethical behaviour (including breaches of laws or regulations) and wider or cumulative organisational cultural failings.\n\n• Inadequate business resilience: Risks associated with unanticipated or unforeseeable adverse events and a failure of planning and preparedness to respond to, manage and recover from adverse events (including potential physical impacts of climate change).\n\n          56\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nFull details of dividends are given on page 18.\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nThe Directors of BHP at any time during or since the end of the half year ended 31 December 2021 are: Ken MacKenzie – Chairman since September 2017 (a Director since September 2016)\n\nMike Henry – an Executive Director since January 2020\n\nTerry Bowen – a Director since October 2017\n\nMalcolm Broomhead – a Director since March 2010\n\nXiaoqun Clever – a Director since October 2020\n\nIan Cockerill – a Director since April 2019\n\nAnita Frew – a former Director from September 2015 to November 2021 Gary Goldberg – a Director since February 2020\n\nSusan Kilsby – a former Director from April 2019 to November 2021 John Mogford – a Director since October 2017\n\nChristine O’Reilly – a Director since October 2020\n\nDion Weisler – a Director since June 2020\n\nAuditor’s independence declaration\n\nErnst & Young in Australia are the auditors of BHP Group Limited.

Complying with International Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), Australian Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001.\n\nBasis for conclusion\n\nWe conducted our review in accordance with Australian Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (ASRE 2410). Our responsibilities are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the review of the half- year financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the annual financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.\n\nDirectors’ responsibilities for the half year financial report\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the half year financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with International Accounting Standards as issued by the IASB, Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the half year financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nAuditor’s responsibilities for the review of the half year financial report\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half year financial report based on our review. ASRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe that the half year financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 31 December 2021 and its performance for the half year ended on that date, and complying with International Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the IASB, Australian Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001.\n\n60\n\nA member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited\n\nLiability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nA review of a half year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.

The APMs and below reconciliations included in this document for the half year ended 31 December 2021 and comparative periods are unaudited. The APMs are consistent with how management review financial performance of the Group with the Board and the investment community.\n\nWe consider Underlying attributable profit to be a key measure that allows for the comparability of underlying financial performance by excluding the impacts of exceptional items, and Underlying attributable profit (Continuing operations) is the basis on which our dividend payout ratio policy is applied.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA is a key APM that management uses internally to assess the performance of the Group’s segments and make decisions on the allocation of resources. In the Group’s view, this is a relevant measure for capital intensive industries with long-life assets. Underlying EBITDA and Underlying EBIT are included in the Group’s Financial Report, as required by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’.\n\nThe “Definition and calculation of alternative performance measures” section outlines why we believe the APMs are useful and the calculation methodology. We believe these APMs provide useful information, but they should not be considered as an indication of, or as a substitute for, statutory measures as an indicator of actual operating performance (such as profit or net operating cash flow) or any other measure of financial performance or position presented in accordance with IFRS, or as a measure of a company’s profitability, liquidity or financial position.\n\nComparative periods have been adjusted for the effects of applying IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’ and discloses them on the same basis as the current period figures.\n\nThe following tables provide reconciliations between the APMs and their nearest respective IFRS measure.\n\nExceptional items\n\nTo improve the comparability of underlying financial performance between reporting periods, some of our APMs adjust the relevant IFRS measures for exceptional items. Refer to the Group’s Financial Report for further information on exceptional items.\n\nExceptional items are those gains or losses where their nature, including the expected frequency of the events giving rise to them, and impact is considered material to the Group’s Financial Statements. The exceptional items included within the Group’s profit for the period are detailed below.\n\n      Other income\n\nExpenses excluding net finance costs, depreciation, amortisation and impairments

Liability associated with index-linked freight contracts, which are required to be remeasured to the prevailing freight index at each reporting date, are excluded from the net debt calculation due to the short-term volatility of the index they relate to not aligning with how the Group uses net debt for decision making in relation to the Capital Allocation Framework. Net debt includes the fair value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge cash and borrowings to reflect the Group’s risk management strategy of reducing the volatility of net debt caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.\n\nNet debt, along with the gearing ratio, is used to monitor the Group’s capital management by relating net debt relative to equity from shareholders.\n\nInterest bearing liabilities less liability associated with index-linked freight contracts less cash and cash equivalents less net cross currency and interest rate swaps less net cash management related instruments for the Group at the reporting date.\n\n      Gearing ratio\n\nRatio of Net debt to Net debt plus Net assets.\n\n       Net operating assets\n\nEnables a clearer view of the assets deployed to generate earnings by highlighting the net operating assets of the business separate from the financing and tax balances.

A definition and explanation of each of the Key Indicators are provided in the tables below.\n\nHealth and safety-related metrics\n\nOur highest priority is the safety of our people and the communities in which we operate. This is why are focussed on introducing more reliable and effective controls across our safety risk profile and improving human and organisational performance, enabling our people to work safely each day. Our work in fatality elimination is underpinned by our field leadership program, ensuring our leaders are spending quality time in field engaging with our workforce. The health and safety Key Indicators allow the Board, management, investors and other stakeholders to measure and track health and safety performance at our operated assets.\n\nKey Indicator Calculation methodology\n\n     High Potential Injury (HPI)\n\n  High potential injury frequency (HPIF) is an indicator which measures the number of injuries with fatal potential per million hours. HPIFR equals the sum of (lost time cases + restricted work cases + medical treatment cases + first aid cases) x 1,000,000 ÷ total hours worked.\n\nHigh potential injuries remain a primary focus to assess progress against our most important safety objective: to eliminate fatalities.\n\nThe basis of calculation for high potential injuries was revised in FY2020 from event count to injury count as part of a safety reporting methodology improvement. In some events, multiple people are injured.\n\nThis methodology has been prepared in accordance with GRI standard 403-9.\n\n   Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF)\n\n   Total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) is an indicator which measures the number of recordable injuries per million hours. TRIF equals the sum of (fatalities + lost-time cases + restricted work cases + medical treatment cases) x 1,000,000 ÷ total hours worked total exposure hours. BHP adopts the US Government Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines for the recording and reporting of occupational injury and illnesses. TRIF statistics exclude non-operated assets.\n\nYear-on-year improvement of TRIF is one of our five-year sustainability targets and is one of the indicators used to assess our safety performance.\n\nThis methodology has been prepared in accordance with GRI standard 403-9 and OSHA guidelines.\n\n     75\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nAlternative Performance Measures\n\nFresh water withdrawals\n\nWe acknowledge the nature of our operations can have significant environmental impacts. Our water withdrawal metrics allow the Board and management to manage and monitor the inherent risks relating to, and any adverse impacts our operations may have on, water resources. They also allow the Board, management, investors and other stakeholders to measure and track our performance towards our water-use commitments. Water withdrawal metrics assist the Board and management in understanding the significance of our water resource use, collectively for the Group and by individual operated assets, and to assess trends over time. It also helps inform investment in infrastructure to reduce water withdrawals and improve efficiency of water use.\n\nKey Indicator Calculation methodology\n\nPeople-related metrics\n\nOur global workforce is the foundation of our business and we believe that supporting the wellbeing of our people and promoting an inclusive and diverse culture are vital for maintaining a competitive advantage. The proportion of the workforce that are female or Indigenous workers are key indicators, which allow the Board, management, investors and other stakeholders to measure and track our near and long-term progress.\n\nKey Indicator Calculation methodology\n\n      Fresh water withdrawals\n\n  The volume of freshwater, in megalitres (ML), received and intended for use within the reporting period by the operated asset from the water environment and/or a third party supplier.\n\nFresh water is defined as waters other than seawater, wastewater from third parties and hypersaline groundwater. Freshwater withdrawal also excludes entrained water that would not be available for other\n\nuses. These exclusions have been made to align with the target’s intent to reduce the use of freshwater sources subject to competition from other users or the environment.\n\n      Female workforce participation (%)\n\n   The number of female employees as a proportion of the total workforce on the last day of the respective reporting period, used in internal management reporting for the purposes of monitoring progress against our goals.\n\n   Indigenous workforce participation (%)\n\n The number of Indigenous employees as a proportion of the total workforce in the relevant countries on the last day of the respective reporting period, used in internal management reporting for the purposes of monitoring progress against our goals.\n\nThere is no significant seasonal variation in employment numbers.\n\nThese methodologies have been prepared in accordance with GRI standard 102-8 and GRI standard 405-1.\n\n 76\n\nFor personal use only\n\n",

Full year total copper production guidance has been lowered to between 1,570 and 1,620 kt, reflecting lowered production guidance for Escondida. Full year nickel production guidance has been lowered to between 80 and 85 kt due to COVID-19 related labour constraints.\n\n Full year unit cost guidance(1) for Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO), Escondida and Queensland Coal remains unchanged. Full year unit cost guidance for New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) has been increased to between US$76 and US$81 per tonne, reflecting a targeted increase in the proportion of higher quality coal to capture more value from the record high prices for higher quality thermal coal.\n\n Our potash major projects under development are tracking to plan. The Jansen shaft project is 99% complete while Jansen Stage 1 activities continue to progress at the port, the Jansen site and for the underground mining systems.\n\n The divestment of BHP’s interest in BHP Mitsui Coal (BMC) to Stanmore Resources Limited is expected to complete on 3 May 2022.\n\n Completion of the proposed merger of BHP’s oil and gas portfolio with Woodside Petroleum Ltd is targeted for 1 June 2022, subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent including approval by Woodside shareholders at the Woodside general meeting on 19 May 2022.\n\n     Production Mar YTD22 Mar Q22 (vs Mar YTD21) (vs Dec Q21)\n\n     Mar Q22 vs Dec Q21 commentary\n\n   Copper (kt) 1,111.7 369.7 Higher volumes at Olympic Dam following completion of the planned smelter (10%) 1% maintenance campaign. This was partially offset by lower volumes at Escondida mainly due to COVID-19 workforce impacts and public road blockades as a result of\n\nsocial unrest.\n\n    Iron ore (Mt)\n\nMetallurgical coal (Mt)(2) Energy coal (Mt)(3)\n\nNickel (kt)\n\nDiscontinued operations\n\nPetroleum (MMboe)\n\n189.1 59.7 Lower volumes at WAIO reflecting temporary labour constraints due to COVID-19, train 0% (10%) driver shortages and planned maintenance activities. This was partially offset by record\n\nproduction from the MAC hub with the continued ramp up of South Flank.\n\n28.2 10.6 Increased volumes as a result of lower rainfall than the prior period coupled with (2%) 20% strong operational performance driven by improved truck productivity.\n\n9.8 2.6 Lower volumes due to continued wet weather and COVID-19 related absenteeism (1%) (13%) impacting stripping and mine productivity, as well as an increased proportion of higher\n\nquality products.\n\n58.0 18.7 Lower volumes reflecting temporary labour constraints due to COVID-19 related (13%) (13%) absenteeism and workforce shortages.\n\n77.3 24.1 Lower volumes due to reduced seasonal gas demand at Bass Strait and lower well 2% (6%) productivity at Atlantis.\n\n                      Group copper equivalent production decreased by 3%(4) over the nine months ended 31 March 2022 mainly due to lower copper volumes.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the nine months ended 31 March 2022 1\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Summary\n\n   BHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry:\n\n“BHP delivered safe and reliable production in the third quarter. Our WA iron ore business continues to perform strongly as we navigate the state’s first major COVID-19 wave, and we remain on track to achieve full year volume and cost guidance. Amid record high prices, our Queensland metallurgical coal business delivered strong underlying performance and benefited from better weather in the quarter.\n\nIn copper, Spence production is increasing and the Olympic Dam smelter is performing strongly as it returns to full production following planned maintenance. These gains have been more than offset at Escondida by impacts from COVID-19 and public road blockades in Antofagasta, which are reflected in a revision to overall production guidance.\n\nOur Jansen potash project is on track, with good progress on the shafts, in the underground mining systems and at the port. The merger of our petroleum assets with Woodside has progressed and is set for completion in June 2022, while\n\n the divestment of our BMC business to Stanmore should complete in May 2022.\n\nMarket volatility and inflationary pressures have increased further as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We continue our work to mitigate cost pressures through a sharp focus on operational reliability and cost discipline. While we expect conditions to improve during the course of the 2023 calendar year, we anticipate the skills shortages and overall labour market tightness in Australia and Chile to continue in the period ahead.\n\nOur hearts go out to all those impacted by the tragic events in Ukraine. The BHP Foundation has donated US$5 million to aid the response to the humanitarian crisis.”\n\n Operational performance\n\nProduction and guidance are summarised below.\n\nNote: All guidance is subject to further potential impacts from COVID-19 during the 2022 financial year.\n\n        Mar Production YTD22\n\nMar YTD22 Mar vs Q22 Mar YTD21\n\nMar Q22 vs Mar Q21\n\n(6%) (9%) 31%\n\n(30%) 4% 1%\n\n0% 0% 13% 10%\n\n3% 41% 7% (14%) (8%)\n\n(5%)\n\nMar Q22 vs Dec Q21\n\n1% (7%) 0% >100% (6%) (10%)\n\n(10%) (10%)\n\n(3%) 20% 26%\n\n4% 22% (13%) (13%)\n\n(6%)\n\nPrevious FY22 guidance\n\n1,590 – 1,760 1,020 – 1,080 260 – 300 140 – 150 120 – 140 249 – 259\n\n246 – 255 278 – 288\n\n3–4 38–41 - - 68–72 13–15 85–95\n\n-\n\nCurrent FY22 guidance\n\n1,570 – 1,620 1,000 – 1,030 260 – 300 140 – 150 120 – 140 249 – 259\n\n246 – 255 278 – 288\n\n3–4 38–41 29–31 9 – 10 68–72 13–15 80–85\n\n-\n\n        Copper (kt) Escondida (kt) Pampa Norte (kt) Olympic Dam (kt) Antamina (kt)\n\nIron ore (Mt)\n\nWAIO (Mt)\n\nWAIO (100% basis) (Mt) Samarco (Mt)\n\nMetallurgical coal (Mt)(i)\n\nBMA (Mt)\n\nBHP Mitsui Coal (100% basis) (Mt) Queensland Coal (100% basis) (Mt)\n\nEnergy coal – NSWEC (Mt) Nickel (kt)\n\nDiscontinued operations Petroleum (MMboe)(ii)\n\n1,111.7 369.7 714.7 226.4 204.0 68.2\n\n82.7 39.0 110.3 36.1 189.1 59.7 186.0 58.7 211.1 66.7\n\n3.1 1.0 28.2 10.6 21.0 7.9\n\n7.3 2.6 49.2 18.5 9.8 2.6 58.0 18.7\n\n77.3 24.1\n\n(10%) (13%) 37% (46%) 2% 0% (1%)\n\n0% >100% (2%) (7%) 18% (4%) (1%) (13%)\n\n2%\n\nLowered\n\nLowered Unchanged Lower end Upper end\n\nUnchanged Unchanged Upper end\n\nUnchanged\n\nUnchanged Unchanged Lowered\n\n                                                                          (i) Completion of the divestment of BMC is expected on 3 May 2022. Full year BMA and BMC production guidance has been itemised under Queensland Coal, however economic and operating control of BMC will transfer to Stanmore Resources Limited once the sale has completed.\n\n(ii) Given our announcement of a binding share sale agreement for the proposed merger of BHP’s oil and gas portfolio with Woodside in November 2021 with completion of the merger expected to occur on 1 June 2022, no further annual production guidance for Petroleum will be provided. The effective date of the merger is 1 July 2021.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the nine months ended 31 March 2022 2\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nMajor development projects\n\nAt the end of March 2022, BHP had two major projects under development, the US$2.97 billion Jansen mine shafts project and the US$5.7 billion Jansen Stage 1 project. Our major projects under development are tracking to plan.\n\nCorporate update\n\nPortfolio\n\nIn February 2022, BHP advanced its early-stage copper interests by investing C$100 million to acquire a five per cent equity interest in Filo Mining, a Toronto Stock Exchange listed exploration and development company. Filo Mining owns the Filo del Sol project located in the Atacama Region of Chile and adjacent to the San Juan Province in Argentina, which is in the advanced exploration stage. The proceeds from BHP’s investment will be used for exploration and project studies. Filo Mining and BHP have agreed to form a joint advisory committee to share expertise, exploration concepts, and discuss future project development options.\n\nAll conditions precedent under the Share Sale and Purchase Agreement for the divestment of BHP’s 80 per cent interest in BMC to Stanmore Resources Limited have been satisfied, and completion is expected to occur on 3 May 2022. The purchase price comprises US$1.1 billion cash on completion, US$100 million in cash six months after completion and the potential for up to US$150 million in a commodity price-linked earnout payable in the 2024 calendar year.\n\nCompletion of the merger of BHP’s oil and gas portfolio with Woodside is targeted for 1 June 2022, subject to satisfaction of conditions precedent including approval by Woodside shareholders at the Woodside general meeting on 19 May 2022. All required regulatory and competition approvals have been obtained, other than the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator approval which is expected prior to completion. BHP is expected to receive 914,768,948 newly issued Woodside shares at completion and determine a fully franked in specie dividend of the Woodside shares to BHP shareholders. BHP shareholders are expected to be entitled to one Woodside share for every 5.5340 BHP shares they hold on the BHP register at the record date of 26 May 2022. Additional information on the proposed in specie dividend and share distribution can be found in our announcement on 8 April 2022.\n\nSamarco\n\nSamarco’s Judicial Reorganisation process is continuing in the Commercial Courts of Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais. The Judicial Reorganisation is a process for Samarco to restructure its financial debts in order to establish a sustainable independent financial position that would allow Samarco to continue its operations safely and meet its Renova Foundation obligations. BHP Brasil will continue to support Samarco in this process. The Judicial Reorganisation does not affect Samarco’s obligation or commitment to make full redress for the 2015 Fundão dam failure, and it does not impact Renova Foundation’s ability to undertake remediation and compensation works. BHP Brasil and Vale each hold a 50 per cent interest in Samarco.\n\nSeparately, negotiations are also ongoing with State and Federal Prosecutors and other Brazilian public authorities on the review of the Framework Agreement(5), seeking a definitive and substantive settlement of Brazilian claims relating to the dam failure.\n\n BHP Operational Review for the nine months ended 31 March 2022 3\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Copper\n\n Production\n\nCopper (kt) Zinc (t) Uranium (t)\n\nMar YTD22\n\n1,111.7 95,624 1,599\n\nMar Q22\n\n369.7 32,732 781\n\nMar YTD22 vs Mar YTD21\n\n(10%) (13%) (40%)\n\nMar Q22 vs Mar Q21\n\n(6%) (2%) (6%)\n\nMar Q22 vs Dec Q21\n\n1% 11% >100%\n\n                          Copper – Total copper production decreased by 10 per cent to 1,112 kt. Guidance for the 2022 financial year has been lowered to between 1,570 and 1,620 kt, from between 1,590 and 1,760 kt, which reflects lowered production guidance for Escondida.\n\nOur Chilean assets experienced a challenging operating environment in the March 2022 quarter due to a reduction in our operational workforce as a result of a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in Chile, particularly the Omicron variant, and the mitigation measures implemented. This is despite high COVID-19 vaccination rates and continued use of control measures at our operating sites.\n\nEscondida copper production decreased by 13 per cent to 715 kt primarily due to grade decline in the current mining area, the impact of a reduced operational workforce from COVID-19 and public road blockades associated with social unrest affecting access to site for both workers and supplies. Escondida achieved record material mined for the nine months to March 2022 despite these challenges. Production guidance for the 2022 financial year has been lowered to between 1,000 and 1,030 kt, from between 1,020 and 1,080 kt, reflecting the impact of increased COVID-19 cases and related supply constraints, as well as the road blockades. Concentrator feed grade decline in the current mining area remains forecast at approximately 2 per cent for the year. Medium term guidance of an annual average of 1.2 Mt of copper production over the next five years remains unchanged, with production expected to be weighted towards the latter years.\n\nPampa Norte copper production increased by 37 per cent to 204 kt, reflecting the continued ramp up of the Spence Growth Option (SGO), partially offset by the impact of lower cathode production as a result of grade decline and the public road blockades. Ore stacking grade for cathodes is now expected to decline by approximately 15 per cent for the 2022 financial year due to a change in mine sequencing. Production guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 260 and 300 kt. We continue to progress the plant design modifications required at SGO to achieve planned copper production levels. The Spence guidance to average 300 ktpa (including cathodes) in the first four years of production will be subject to the timing of these modifications being completed.\n\nOlympic Dam copper production decreased by 46 per cent to 83 kt as a result of the execution of the major smelter maintenance campaign which was completed in January 2022. The subsequent smelter ramp up to full capacity was achieved in April 2022, and has delivered 17 per cent higher smelted tonnes compared to the ramp up after the prior maintenance campaign in 2017. Production for the 2022 financial year is expected to be at the lower end of the guidance range of between 140 and 150 kt primarily as a result of COVID-19 related impacts to the completion of the smelter maintenance campaign.\n\nAntamina copper production increased by two per cent to 110 kt, reflecting higher copper head grades. Zinc production decreased by 13 per cent to 96 kt reflecting lower zinc head grades. Production guidance remains unchanged, with copper production expected to be at the upper end of the 120 to 140 kt guidance range, and zinc production between 115 and 130 kt.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the nine months ended 31 March 2022 4\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Iron Ore\n\n Production\n\nIron ore production (kt)\n\nMar YTD22\n\n189,101\n\nMar Q22\n\n59,700\n\nMar YTD22 vs Mar YTD21\n\n0%\n\nMar Q22 Mar Q22 vs vs Mar Q21 Dec Q21\n\n1% (10%)\n\n              Iron ore – Total iron ore production in line with the prior period at 189 Mt. Production guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 249 and 259 Mt.\n\nWAIO production of 186 Mt (211 Mt on a 100 per cent basis) was in line with the prior period. The impacts of temporary labour constraints relating to COVID-19, train driver shortages, planned track renewal works in the March 2022 quarter, and the planned major maintenance on car dumper one and the Jimblebar train load out in the first half were offset by continued strong supply chain performance, including higher car dumper performance, and favourable weather compared to the prior period. South Flank ramp up to full production capacity of 80 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) over three years remains on track with an average rate of 58 Mtpa achieved in the March 2022 quarter contributing to record production from the MAC hub and record lump sales.\n\nProduction guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 246 and 255 Mt (278 and 288 Mt on a 100 per cent basis). Production in the June 2022 quarter is expected to be impacted by continued COVID-19 related absenteeism as Western Australia approaches anticipated peak case numbers, and planned car dumper maintenance.\n\nSamarco production was 3.1 Mt (BHP share), following the recommencement of iron ore pellet production at one concentrator in December 2020. Production guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 3 and 4 Mt (BHP share), with production expected to be at the upper end of the guidance range.\n\n  Coal\n\nProduction\n\nMetallurgical coal (kt)(2) Energy coal (kt)(3)\n\nMar YTD22\n\n28,230 9,782\n\nMar Q22\n\n10,562 2,577\n\nMar YTD22 vs Mar YTD21\n\n(2%) (1%)\n\nMar Q22 vs Mar Q21\n\n10% (14%)\n\nMar Q22 vs Dec Q21\n\n20% (13%)\n\n                     Metallurgical coal – Metallurgical coal production decreased by two per cent to 28 Mt (49 Mt on a 100 per cent basis). Queensland Coal production guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 38 and 41 Mt (68 and 72 Mt on a 100 per cent basis), of which BMA is expected to contribute between 29 and 31 Mt, and BMC is expected to contribute between 9 and 10 Mt. The divestment of BHP’s 80 per cent interest in BMC to Stanmore Resources Limited is expected to complete on 3 May 2022 upon which date the economic interest in and operating control of BMC transfers to Stanmore Resources Limited.\n\nAt Queensland Coal, strong underlying operational performance, including improvements in underlying truck productivity, have been offset by significant wet weather impacts across most operations in the first half of the year and labour constraints, including COVID-19 related absenteeism, impacting stripping and mine productivity. Labour shortages and COVID-19 related absenteeism remain a risk for the remainder of the year.\n\nEnergy coal – Energy coal production is broadly in line with the prior period at 10 Mt. Production guidance for the 2022 financial year remains unchanged at between 13 and 15 Mt.\n\nAt NSWEC, continued wet weather and COVID-19 related labour constraints impacted stripping performance and mine productivity in the March 2022 quarter, offsetting the strong first half operational performance. Higher quality products now make up almost 90 per cent of sales compared to approximately 65 per cent of sales in the prior period, maximising the benefit from the widening price spread.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the nine months ended 31 March 2022 5\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Other\n\n Nickel production\n\nNickel (kt)\n\nMar YTD22 Mar Q22\n\n58.0 18.7\n\nMar YTD22 Mar Q22 Mar Q22 vs vs vs Mar YTD21 Mar Q21 Dec Q21\n\n(13%) (8%) (13%)\n\n             Nickel – Nickel West production decreased by 13 per cent to 58 kt due to the impacts of COVID-19 related labour absenteeism and workforce shortages in the March 2022 quarter, planned asset integrity work to support operational stability completed in the December 2021 quarter, as well as planned maintenance in the September 2021 quarter. Production guidance for the 2022 financial year has been lowered to between 80 and 85 kt from between 85 and 95 kt, largely reflecting the impact from COVID-19 related labour constraints.\n\nPotash – Our potash major projects under development are tracking to plan.

Greenfield minerals exploration is being undertaken on advancing copper targets in Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Canada, Australia and the south-west United States. Nickel targets are also being advanced in Canada and Australia. Specifically in copper, we are testing targets with drilling in Chile, Ecuador, the United States and Australia.\n\nIn April 2022, BHP agreed to fund a new C$2 million nickel exploration program in Nunavik, Quebec as part of its strategic alliance with Midland Exploration(6). The exploration program will run during the 2022 calendar year and consist of regional magnetotelluric surveys, as well as two phases of prospecting.\n\nAt Oak Dam in South Australia, BHP is continuing next stage resource definition drilling with four drill rigs now active on site, an increase from two drill rigs previously, after commencing the program in May 2021.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the nine months ended 31 March 2022 6\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Discontinued operations - Petroleum\n\n Production\n\nCrude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (MMboe) Natural gas (bcf)\n\nTotal petroleum production (MMboe)\n\nMar YTD22 Mar Q22\n\n36.6 11.5 244.4 75.9 77.3 24.1\n\nMar YTD22 vs Mar YTD21\n\n8% (3%) 2%\n\nMar Q22 vs Mar Q21\n\n(1%) (8%) (5%)\n\nMar Q22 vs Dec Q21\n\n(7%) (5%) (6%)\n\n                         Completion of the proposed merger of BHP’s oil and gas portfolio with Woodside Petroleum Ltd is targeted for 1 June 2022, subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent including approval by Woodside shareholders at the Woodside general meeting on 19 May 2022. The effective date of the merger is 1 July 2021. The half year financial results for 31 December 2021 were prepared on the basis that BHP Petroleum is a discontinued operation.\n\nTotal petroleum production increased by two per cent to 77 MMboe. No further production guidance for the 2022 financial year will be provided for Petroleum given the business is presented as a discontinued operation.\n\nCrude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production increased by eight per cent to 37 MMboe, reflecting the additional 28 percent working interest acquired in Shenzi in November 2020, new production from Atlantis and Shenzi, increased volumes from Ruby following first production in May 2021, and lower impact from weather events in the Gulf of Mexico. The increase was partially offset by natural field decline across the portfolio.\n\nNatural gas production decreased by three per cent to 244 bcf, reflecting natural field decline, decreased production at North West Shelf and unplanned downtime at Angostura. The decline in production has been partially offset by increased volumes from Ruby and higher seasonal demand for gas at Bass Strait.\n\nProjects\n\nProject and Capital ownership expenditure US$M\n\nInitial production target date\n\nH2 CY22\n\nCY24\n\nCY26\n\nCapacity\n\nNew floating production facility with the capacity to produce up to 140,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n\nA two-well subsea tie-in to the Shenzi platform, with the capacity to produce up to 30,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n\nNew upstream facilities designed to deliver daily gas quantities to manufacture 8 Mtpa LNG and 180 TJ/day of domestic gas.\n\nProgress\n\nFirst production is expected in the second half of the 2022 calendar year.

These statements discuss future expectations concerning the results of assets or financial conditions, or provide other forward-looking information.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are based on the information available as at the date of this presentation and/or the date of the Group’s planning processes or scenario analysis processes. There are inherent limitations with scenario analysis and it is difficult to predict which, if any, of the scenarios might eventuate. Scenarios do not constitute definitive outcomes for us. Scenario analysis relies on assumptions that may or may not be, or prove to be, correct and may or may not eventuate, and scenarios may be impacted by additional factors to the assumptions disclosed. Additionally, forward-looking statements are not guarantees or predictions of future performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements contained in this presentation. BHP cautions against reliance on any forward-looking statements or guidance, particularly in light of the current economic climate and the significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption arising in connection with COVID-19.\n\nFor example, our future revenues from our assets, projects or mines described in this release will be based, in part, upon the market price of the minerals, metals or petroleum produced, which may vary significantly from current levels. These variations, if materially adverse, may affect the timing or the feasibility of the development of a particular project, the expansion of certain facilities or mines, or the continuation of existing assets.\n\nOther factors that may affect the actual construction or production commencement dates, costs or production output and anticipated lives of assets, mines or facilities include our ability to profitably produce and transport the minerals, petroleum and/or metals extracted to applicable markets; the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the market prices of the minerals, petroleum or metals we produce; activities of government authorities in the countries where we sell our products and in the countries where we are exploring or developing projects, facilities or mines, including increases in taxes; changes in environmental and other regulations; the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business; political uncertainty; labour unrest; and other factors identified in the risk factors discussed in BHP’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‘SEC’) (including in Annual Reports on Form 20-F) which are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\n\nExcept as required by applicable regulations or by law, BHP does not undertake to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. Past performance cannot be relied on as a guide to future performance.\n\nPresentation of data\n\nNumbers presented may not add up precisely to the totals provided due to rounding.\n\nNo offer of securities\n\nNothing in this presentation should be construed as either an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities, or a solicitation of any vote or approval, in any jurisdiction, or be treated or relied upon as a recommendation or advice by BHP. No offer of securities shall be made in the United States absent registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, such registration requirements.\n\nReliance on third party information\n\nThe views expressed in this presentation contain information that has been derived from publicly available sources that have not been independently verified. No representation or warranty is made as to the accuracy, completeness or reliability of the information. This presentation should not be relied upon as a recommendation or forecast by BHP.\n\nBHP and its subsidiaries\n\nIn this presentation, the terms ‘BHP’, the ‘Company’, the ‘Group’, ‘our business’, ‘organization’, ‘Group’, ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ refer to BHP Group Limited, BHP Group Plc and, except where the context otherwise requires, their respective subsidiaries set out in note 13 ‘Related undertaking of the Group’ in section 5.2 of BHP’s Annual Report and Form 20-F. Those terms do not include non-operated assets. This presentation includes references to BHP’s assets (including those under exploration, projects in development or execution phases, sites and closed operations) that have been wholly owned and/or operated by BHP and that have been owned as a joint venture operated by BHP (referred to as ‘operated assets’ or ‘operations’) during the period from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021. Our functions are also included.\n\nBHP also holds interests in assets that are owned as a joint venture but not operated by BHP (referred to in this release as ‘non-operated joint ventures’ or ‘non-operated assets’). Our non-operated assets include Antamina, Cerrejón, Samarco, Atlantis, Mad Dog, Bass Strait and North West Shelf. Notwithstanding that this presentation may include production, financial and other information from non-operated assets, non-operated assets are not included in the Group and, as a result, statements regarding our operations, assets and values apply only to our operated assets unless otherwise stated. References in this presentation to a ‘joint venture’ are used for convenience to collectively describe assets that are not wholly owned by BHP. Such references are not intended to characterise the legal relationship between the owners of the asset.\n\nBMO Farm to Market\n\n19 May 2022 2\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\n BHP: Sector leading

We remained fatality free during the year and have delivered record sales volumes from Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO), allowing us to fully capitalise on the opportunity presented by high iron ore prices.\n\n Full year production guidance for iron ore and energy coal were achieved, as were revised guidance for copper and metallurgical coal. Full year nickel production was lower than revised guidance due to a smelter outage in the June 2022 quarter.\n\n Full year unit cost guidance1 is expected to be achieved for WAIO and Escondida. New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) unit costs are expected to be towards the bottom end of revised guidance, which was updated to reflect a targeted increase in the proportion of higher quality energy coal to capture more value from record high prices. BMA unit costs are expected to be marginally above revised guidance for Queensland Coal primarily due to the impact of the divestment of BMC.\n\n The Jansen shaft project was completed in the June 2022 quarter. Jansen Stage 1 is tracking to plan, with activities progressing at the port and at the Jansen site. We are working to bring forward Jansen Stage 1 first production into 2026 and are assessing options to accelerate Jansen Stage 2.\n\n The divestment of BHP’s 80% interest in BMC to Stanmore and the merger of BHP’s oil and gas portfolio with Woodside Energy were completed during the June 2022 quarter.\n\n BHP announced that it will retain NSWEC in its portfolio and seek relevant approvals to enable mining beyond the current mining consent that expires in 2026, towards a cessation of mining in 2030.\n\n The financial results for the second half of the 2022 financial year are expected to reflect certain items as summarised in the table on page 3.\n\n     Production FY22 Jun Q22 (vs FY21) (vs Mar Q22)\n\n     Jun Q22 vs Mar Q22 commentary\n\n Copper (kt)\n\nIron ore (Mt) Metallurgical coal (Mt)2 Energy coal (Mt)3 Nickel (kt)\n\n1,573.5 461.8 Higher volumes at Escondida due to increased grade and concentrator throughput, (4%) 25% at Spence due to improved leaching performance and at Olympic Dam following major\n\nsmelter maintenance campaign impacts in the prior period.\n\n253.2 64.2 Higher volumes at WAIO reflecting record production from the Mining Area C hub with 0% 8% the continued ramp up of South Flank and improved supply chain performance.\n\n29.1 8.2 Higher volumes driven by improved truck productivity, partially offset by heavy rainfall (9%) 3% in the quarter.\n\n13.7 3.9 Higher volumes due to less wet weather and reduced COVID-19 related labour (4%) 52% impacts.\n\n76.8 18.8 Higher volumes due to reduced COVID-19 labour impacts, offset by an unplanned (14%) 1% smelter outage.\n\n                  Group copper equivalent production for the 2022 financial year decreased by 4%4 mainly due to lower copper and coal volumes. Group copper equivalent production for the 2023 financial year is expected to increase by approximately 4% from the 2022 financial year.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the year ended 30 June 2022 1\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Summary\n\n   BHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry:\n\n“BHP produced a strong fourth quarter to cap off a year of significant progress. Our performance for the year has been underpinned by safe, reliable operations and firm demand for our commodities. We completed another year fatality free and we are unwavering in our effort to improve safety, and this includes addressing sexual assault and harassment, racism and bullying.\n\nWe delivered record full-year sales volumes at our iron ore business in Western Australia as a result of reliable operational performance and the South Flank project which continued to ramp up. In copper, Escondida in Chile had record material mined and near-record concentrator throughput, while Olympic Dam in South Australia performed strongly in the fourth quarter after planned smelter maintenance.\n\nQueensland metallurgical coal delivered strong underlying performance for the quarter in the face of significant wet\n\n weather. BHP is assessing the impacts on BMA economic reserves and mine lives as a result of the increase in coal royalties by the Queensland Government. The near tripling of top end royalties has worsened what was already one of the world’s highest coal royalty regimes, threatening investment and jobs in the state.\n\nOur US$5.7 billion Jansen potash project in Canada is tracking to plan and we are working to bring first production forward to 2026. Also during the year, we merged our petroleum business with Woodside, completed the sales of BMC and Cerrejón, and decided to retain New South Wales Energy Coal until the cessation of mining in 2030 subject to relevant approvals. We also unified our corporate structure, and added to our global options in copper and nickel.\n\nBroader market volatility continues and we expect the lag effect of inflationary pressures to continue through the 2023 financial year, along with labour market tightness and supply chain constraints. Over the year ahead, China is expected to contribute positively to growth as stimulus policies take effect, however, the continuing conflict in the Ukraine, the unfolding energy crisis in Europe and policy tightening globally is expected to result in an overall slowing of global growth. Our strong focus on safety, operational reliability, cost control and social value will help us navigate these challenges and continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders.”\n\n Operational performance\n\nProduction and guidance are summarised below.\n\nNote: All guidance is subject to further potential impacts from COVID-19 during the 2023 financial year.\n\n        Productioni FY22\n\nFY22 Jun vs Q22 FY21\n\n461.8 (4%) 289.3 (6%) 77.2 29% 55.7 (33%) 39.6 4% 64.2 0% 63.2 (1%) 71.7 0% 1.0 110% 8.2 (9%) 16.4 (9%) 3.9 (4%) 18.8 (14%)\n\nJun Q22 vs Jun Q21\n\n15% 17% 11% 10% 10% (2%) (2%) (2%) (2%)\n\n(12%) (12%) (13%) (16%)\n\nJun Q22 vs Mar Q22\n\n25% 28% 13% 43% 10%\n\n8% 8% 7% 1% 3% 3%\n\n52% 1%\n\nFY23 guidance\n\n1,635 – 1,825 1,080 – 1,180 240 – 290 195 – 215 120 – 140 249 – 260 246 – 256 278 – 290 3–4 29 – 32 58 – 64 13 – 15 80 – 90\n\nFY23e vs FY22\n\n4%–16%\n\n8%–18% (15%) – 3% 41% – 55%\n\n(20%) – (7%) (2%) – 3% (1%) – 3% (2%) – 3% (26%) – (2%) 0% – 10% 0% – 10% (5%) – 9% 4% – 17%\n\n        Copper (kt) Escondida (kt) Pampa Norte (kt) Olympic Dam (kt) Antamina (kt)\n\nIron ore (Mt)\n\nWAIO (Mt)\n\nWAIO (100% basis) (Mt) Samarco (Mt)\n\nMetallurgical coal - BMA (Mt)\n\nMetallurgical coal - BMA (100% basis) (Mt)\n\nEnergy coal – NSWEC (Mt) Nickel (kt)\n\n1,573.5 1,004.0 281.2 138.4 149.9 253.2 249.2 282.8 4.1 29.1 58.3 13.7 76.8\n\n                                                         i Excludes BMC and Petroleum production.

The table does not provide a comprehensive list of all items impacting the period. The financial statements are the subject of ongoing work that will not be finalised until the release of BHP’s financial results on 16 August 2022.

The net payment to Woodside is subject to a customary post-completion review which may result in an adjustment to the amount paid. In addition, US$0.4 billion in cash was left in the BHP Petroleum bank accounts.\n\nMajor development projects\n\nIn June 2022, we completed the US$2.97 billion Jansen mine shafts project.\n\nAt the end of the 2022 financial year, BHP had one major project under development, the US$5.7 billion Jansen Stage 1 project, which is tracking to plan.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the year ended 30 June 2022 3\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nAverage realised prices\n\nThe average realised prices achieved for our major commodities are summarised below.\n\n4.02 4.31 4.16 3.81 9% (7%) (7%) 112.65 113.54 113.10 130.56 (13%) (29%) (1%)\n\ni Based on provisional, unaudited estimates. Prices exclude sales from equity accounted investments, third party product and internal sales, and represent the weighted average of various sales terms (for example: FOB, CIF and CFR), unless otherwise noted. Includes the impact of provisional pricing and finalisation adjustments.\n\nii Hard coking coal (HCC) refers generally to those metallurgical coals with a Coke Strength after Reaction (CSR) of 35 and above, which includes coals across the spectrum from Premium Coking to Semi Hard Coking coals, while weak coking coal (WCC) refers generally to those metallurgical coals with a CSR below 35.\n\niii Includes thermal coal sales from metallurgical coal mines.\n\nThe large majority of iron ore shipments were linked to index pricing for the month of shipment, with price differentials predominantly a reflection of market fundamentals and product quality. Iron ore sales for the June 2022 half year were based on an average moisture rate of 6.9 per cent. The large majority of metallurgical coal and energy coal exports were linked to index pricing for the month of scheduled shipment or priced on the spot market at fixed or index-linked prices, with price differentials reflecting product quality. The majority of copper cathodes sales were linked to index price for quotation periods one month after month of shipment, and three to four months after month of shipment for copper concentrates sales with price differentials applied for location and treatment costs.\n\nAt 30 June 2022, the Group had 354 kt of outstanding copper sales that were revalued at a weighted average price of US$3.75 per pound. The final price of these sales will be determined in the 2023 financial year. In addition, 323 kt of copper sales from the 2021 financial year were subject to a finalisation adjustment in the current financial year. The provisional pricing and finalisation adjustments will decrease Underlying EBITDA by US$473 million in the 2022 financial year and are included in the average realised copper price in the above table.\n\nCorporate update\n\nPortfolio\n\nIn April 2022, we signed a letter of intent with a consortium led by the Global Maritime forum to assess the development of an iron ore Green Corridor between Australia and East Asia. Green Corridors are specific shipping routes where the economics, infrastructure and logistics of zero or near-zero emission shipping are more feasible and where deployment can be supported by targeted policy and industry action. The new consortium will facilitate a robust public-private dialogue to investigate conditions that need to be in place to mobilise demand and to feasibly scale zero or near-zero- greenhouse gas emission shipping on the corridor.\n\nOn 3 May 2022, BHP completed the sale of its 80 per cent interest in BMC to Stanmore Resources Limited. Stanmore Resources paid US$1.1 billion cash consideration at completion plus a preliminary completion adjustment of approximately US$200 million for working capital. US$100 million cash remains payable to BHP on 3 November 2022 with potential for an additional amount of up to US$150 million in a price-linked earnout payable to BHP in the 2024 calendar year. The total cash consideration for the transaction could be up to US$1.35 billion plus the final completion adjustment amount. The Group expects to recognise a net gain on sale of between US$825 million and US$875 million post-tax as an exceptional item in the 2022 financial year.\n\nOn 1 June 2022, the merger of BHP’s oil and gas portfolio with Woodside was completed. BHP paid a fully franked in specie dividend and distributed Woodside shares to eligible BHP shareholders. The implied value of the in specie dividend was approximately US$19.6 billion or US$3.86 per BHP share. The sale of the Woodside shares of ineligible overseas shareholders and BHP shareholders that elected to participate in the sale facility, was completed and the proceeds have been distributed to participating shareholders. As part of completion, BHP made a net cash payment of approximately US$0.7 billion to Woodside. The net payment to Woodside is subject to a customary post-\n\nBHP Operational Review for the year ended 30 June 2022 4\n\n               Average realised pricesi\n\nJun H22 Dec H21 FY22 FY21\n\nFY22 vs FY21\n\nJun H22 vs Jun H21\n\nJun H22 vs Dec H21\n\n         Copper (US$/lb)\n\n  Iron ore (US$/wmt, FOB)\n\n           Metallurgical coal (US$/t) 423.82\n\n259.71 347.10 106.64 225% 269%\n\n63%\n\n           Hard coking coal (US$/t)ii 437.60\n\n278.60 366.82 112.72 225% 269%\n\n57%\n\n           Weak coking coal (US$/t)ii 382.56\n\n218.65 296.51 89.62 231% 266%\n\n75%\n\n           Thermal coal (US$/t)iii 302.60\n\n137.68 216.78 58.42 271% 327%\n\n120%\n\n          Nickel metal (US$/t)   27,399\n\n19,651 23,275 16,250 43% 56%\n\n39%\n\n          For personal use only\n\n\n\ncompletion review which may result in an adjustment to the amount paid. The Group expects to recognise a net gain on the merger of between US$8.0 billion and US$8.3 billion post-tax as an exceptional item in the 2022 financial year5.\n\nOn 16 June 2022, BHP announced that we will retain New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) in our portfolio, seek the relevant approvals to continue mining beyond its current mining consent that expires in 2026 and proceed with a managed process to cease mining at the asset by the end of the 2030 financial year. A trade sale process for NSWEC was conducted however the process did not result in a viable offer. Assessment of the resource economics, geotechnical profile and future investment requirements determined that continued mining in the near term and moving to closure in 2030 provides the optimal financial outcome when compared to alternate options. Continuation of mining to the end of the 2030 financial year will afford eight years to work with our people, state and federal governments and local communities in the Hunter Valley region on a transition approach that supports long-term community sustainability.\n\nSamarco\n\nSamarco’s Judicial Reorganisation process is continuing in the Commercial Courts of Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais. The Judicial Reorganisation is a process for Samarco to restructure its financial debts in order to establish a sustainable independent financial position that would allow Samarco to, among other things, continue its operations safely and meet its Renova Foundation obligations. BHP Brasil will continue to support Samarco in this process. The Judicial Reorganisation is not expected to affect Samarco’s obligation or commitment to make full redress for the 2015 Fundão dam failure, and it does not impact Renova Foundation’s ability to undertake remediation and compensation works.\n\nSeparately, negotiations are also ongoing with State and Federal Prosecutors and other Brazilian public authorities on the review of the Framework Agreement6, seeking a definitive and substantive settlement of Brazilian claims relating to the dam failure.\n\nOn 8 July 2022, the United Kingdom (UK) Court of Appeal decided to allow the group action in the UK against BHP seeking compensation on behalf of individuals, municipalities, private businesses and indigenous peoples in Brazil to continue in the UK. The judgment overturns the earlier decision of the High Court that dismissed the group action. BHP has sought permission to appeal the judgment to the UK Supreme Court. The judgment is not a decision in relation to the merits of the claims made in the group action. It is concerned with the preliminary question of whether the group action can continue against BHP in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe impact of this decision and recent legal decisions in Brazil on the Group’s Samarco provision is currently being assessed.\n\nWe will provide an update to the ongoing potential financial impacts on BHP Brasil of the Samarco dam failure with the release of the financial results on 16 August 2022. Any financial impacts will continue to be treated as an exceptional item.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the year ended 30 June 2022 5\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Copper\n\n Production\n\nCopper (kt) Zinc (t) Uranium (t)\n\nFY22\n\n1,573.5 123,200 2,375\n\nJun Q22\n\n461.8 27,576 776\n\nFY22 Jun Q22 vs vs FY21 Jun Q21\n\n(4%) 15% (15%) (22%) (27%) 26%\n\nJun Q22 vs Mar Q22\n\n25% (16%) (1%)\n\n                          Copper – Total copper production decreased by four per cent to 1,574 kt. Production for the 2023 financial year is expected to be between 1,635 and 1,825 kt.\n\nEscondida copper production decreased by six per cent to 1,004 kt primarily due to higher than expected concentrator feed grade decline of four per cent, public road blockades affecting access to site for both workers and supplies, and the impact of a reduced operational workforce from COVID-19. Despite these challenges, Escondida achieved record material mined for the 2022 financial year and near record concentrator throughput of 367 ktpd. Production is expected to increase to between 1,080 and 1,180 kt for the 2023 financial year and reflects an expected increase in concentrator feed grade compared to the 2022 financial year. Medium term guidance of 1.2 Mtpa of copper production on average over the next five years remains unchanged, with production expected to be weighted towards the latter years.\n\nPampa Norte copper production increased by 29 per cent to 281 kt reflecting the ramp up of the Spence Growth Option (SGO), partially offset by the impact of lower cathode production as a result of a 14 per cent decline in Pampa Norte stacking feed grade. Production for the 2023 financial year is expected to be between 240 and 290 kt. This reflects a forecast decline in stacking feed grade at Pampa Norte, the commencement of plant design modifications at SGO and the continued transition towards the planned closure of Cerro Colorado at the end of the 2023 calendar year.\n\nOlympic Dam copper production decreased by 33 per cent to 138 kt as a result of the major smelter maintenance campaign (SCM21), which included COVID-19 impacts on the availability of workforce and was subsequently completed in January 2022. Near record production in the June 2022 quarter followed the successful ramp up of the smelter to full capacity in April 2022. Average copper grade of 2.14 per cent was achieved in the 2022 financial year as the majority of material mined is from the Southern Mine Area. Production for the 2023 financial year is expected to increase to between 195 and 215 kt.\n\nAntamina copper production increased by four per cent to 150 kt, reflecting higher copper head grades. Zinc production decreased by 15 per cent to 123 kt reflecting lower zinc head grades. Copper production of between 120 and 140 kt, and zinc production of between 115 and 135 kt is expected for the 2023 financial year.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the year ended 30 June 2022 6\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Iron Ore\n\n Production\n\nIron ore production (kt)\n\nFY22\n\n253,247\n\nJun Q22\n\n64,162\n\nFY22 Jun Q22 Jun Q22 vs vs vs FY21 Jun Q21 Mar Q22\n\n0% (2%) 8%\n\n              Iron ore – Total iron ore production was in line with the prior period at 253 Mt. Production for the 2023 financial year is expected to be between 249 and 260 Mt.\n\nWAIO production of 249 Mt (283 Mt on a 100 per cent basis) was in line with the prior period, reflecting continued strong supply chain performance and favourable weather compared to the prior period, offset by the impacts of temporary labour constraints relating to COVID-19, planned track renewal works in the March 2022 quarter and the planned major maintenance on the Jimblebar train load out and car dumper one in the first half. Our preventative maintenance programs continue to underpin the strength of the WAIO supply chain, delivering increased car dumper, reclaimer and ship loader availability year on year and enabling record sales volumes of 284 Mt (100 per cent basis). South Flank ramp up to full production capacity of 80 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) is ahead of schedule with an average rate of 67 Mtpa achieved in the June 2022 quarter contributing to record production from the Mining Area C (MAC) hub and record lump sales.\n\nWAIO production for the 2023 financial year is expected to be between 246 and 256 Mt (278 and 290 Mt on a 100 per cent basis) reflecting the tie-in of the port debottlenecking project (PDP1) and the continued ramp up of South Flank.\n\nSamarco production of 4.1 Mt (BHP share) reflected the ramp up of production to capacity, following the recommencement of iron ore pellet production at one concentrator in December 2020. Production for the 2023 financial year is expected to be between 3 and 4 Mt (BHP share).\n\n  Coal\n\nProduction\n\nMetallurgical coal (kt)2 Energy coal (kt)3\n\nFY22\n\n29,142 13,701\n\nJun Q22\n\n8,183 3,919\n\nFY22 Jun Q22 vs vs FY21 Jun Q21\n\n(9%) (12%) (4%) (13%)\n\nJun Q22 vs Mar Q22\n\n3% 52%\n\n                     Metallurgical coal – BMA production decreased by nine per cent to 29 Mt (58 Mt on a 100 per cent basis). Significant wet weather impacts across most BMA operations and labour constraints, including COVID-19 related absenteeism which impacted stripping and mine productivity, more than offset record production at the Broadmeadow mine. Following the automation of Daunia’s truck fleet in November 2021, the automation of Goonyella’s pre-strip truck fleet was completed in March 2022 with the Goonyella coal truck fleet expected to be fully autonomous by the end of the December 2022 quarter. Production for the 2023 financial year is expected to be between 29 and 32 Mt (58 and 64 Mt on a 100 per cent basis). A long wall move at Broadmeadow mine is scheduled for the September 2022 quarter.\n\nThe divestment of our interest in BMC was completed on 3 May 2022 and BMC volumes are no longer included in metallurgical coal volumes.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the change to the Queensland royalty regime from 1 July 2022, we will assess the impact on production, jobs and the communities of Central Queensland. At spot metallurgical coal prices7, the effective pre-tax royalty rate has increased by approximately 7 percentage points to 19 per cent. This further cost pressure will discourage investment, operational growth, job creation and local business spending across the state. The new tax damages Queensland’s reputation as a stable place to invest, and will make it harder for the state to compete against other global jurisdictions in attracting major new investments that would deliver longer term value to communities and the state economy.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the year ended 30 June 2022 7\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\n  Energy coal – NSWEC production decreased by four per cent to 14 Mt, reflecting lower volumes due to an increased proportion of washed coal to capitalise on higher margins for higher quality coals, COVID-19 related labour constraints which impacted stripping performance and mine productivity, and wet weather. Higher quality coals now make up almost 90 per cent of sales compared to approximately 60 per cent of sales in the prior year. Production for the 2023 financial year is expected to be between 13 and 15 Mt reflecting a continued focus on higher quality coals.\n\n  Other\n\nNickel production\n\nNickel (kt)\n\nFY22 Jun Q22\n\n76.8 18.8\n\nFY22 Jun Q22 Jun Q22 vs vs vs FY21 Jun Q21 Mar Q22\n\n(14%) (16%) 1%\n\n              Nickel – Nickel West production decreased by 14 per cent to 77 kt due to the significant impacts of COVID-19 related labour absenteeism and workforce shortages, and unplanned downtime at the oxygen plant leading to a 15 day smelter outage in the June 2022 quarter. Production for the 2023 financial year is expected to be between 80 and 90 kt, weighted to the second half of the year due to planned smelter maintenance in the first half.\n\nPotash – Our major potash project under development is tracking to plan.

Greenfield minerals exploration is being undertaken on advancing copper targets in Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Canada, Australia and the south-west United States. Nickel targets are also being advanced in Canada and Australia.\n\nWe continued to progress our early stage options in future facing commodities throughout the year. Work continued on the farm-in agreement executed in October 2021 for the early-stage Elliott copper project covering 7,200 km2 in the Northern Territory, Australia, and in April 2022 we agreed to fund a nickel exploration program in Nunavik, Quebec, as part of our strategic alliance with Midland Exploration8.\n\nAt Oak Dam in South Australia, BHP is continuing next stage resource definition drilling with six drill rigs.\n\nBHP Operational Review for the year ended 30 June 2022 8\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nVariance analysis relates to the relative performance of BHP and/or its operations during the 2022 financial year compared with the 2021 financial year, unless otherwise noted.

      "search_text": " 8 August 2022\n\nOZ Minerals rejects Indicative Proposal from BHP\n\nOn 5 August 2022, OZ Minerals Limited (ASX: OZL) received an unsolicited, conditional and non- binding indicative proposal from BHP Group Limited (ASX: BHP) to acquire all shares in OZ Minerals for A$25.00 per share in cash via scheme of arrangement (‘Indicative Proposal’).\n\nThe Indicative Proposal is subject to a number of conditions including:\n\n• the completion of extensive financial, legal, technical and operational due diligence over a proposed 6-week timeframe;\n\n• various financial assumptions;\n\n• a unanimous recommendation of the OZ Minerals Board (‘Board’); and\n\n• entry into a scheme implementation agreement subject to a range of conditions including no material adverse change, regulatory, shareholder and court approvals and conduct of business restrictions.\n\nThe Board has also been advised by BHP that it has accumulated an interest in OZ Minerals shares via derivative instruments amounting to an interest of less than 5%.\n\nThe Board has carefully assessed the Indicative Proposal including with the assistance of its financial and legal advisers. The Board has unanimously determined that the Indicative Proposal significantly undervalues OZ Minerals and, as such, is not in the best interests of shareholders.\n\nOZ Minerals Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Cole said:\n\n“We have a unique set of copper and nickel assets, all with strong long-term growth potential in quality locations. We are mining minerals that are in strong demand particularly for the global electrification and decarbonisation thematic and we have a long-life Resource and Reserve base. We do not consider the proposal from BHP sufficiently recognises these attributes”.\n\nIn coming to its decision, the Board considered that the Indicative Proposal does not adequately compensate shareholders for:\n\n• the unique nature of OZ Minerals’ core business which represents a high-quality portfolio of copper and nickel assets, located in a Tier-1 mining jurisdiction with long mine lives, first quartile cost positioning and extensive strategic optionality;\n\n• the unique investment proposition which OZ Minerals provides as the only primary copper company in the ASX100;\n\nOZ Minerals Limited | ABN: 40 005 482 824 | 2 Hamra Drive, Adelaide Airport, South Australia 5950 T: +61 8 8229 6600 | F: +61 8 8229 6601 | info@ozminerals.com | www.ozminerals.com\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\n• the low carbon intensity of OZ Minerals’ assets relative to its peers with a defined and market- leading plan for further decarbonisation to meet our target of net zero Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions by 2030;\n\n• the high-quality nature of OZ Minerals’ growth projects which include the West Musgrave Project (FID scheduled for H2 2022), the Carrapateena Block Cave and the Prominent Hill Extension which together are expected to generate significant production growth over the next 5 years;\n\n• the strong long-term outlook for both the copper and nickel markets underpinned by increasing geological scarcity, global electrification and accelerating decarbonisation, to which OZ Minerals is highly leveraged; and\n\n• the strong and consistent returns that the OZ Minerals management team has delivered with a total shareholder return of ~145% over the past 5 years.\n\nIn addition to the above, OZ Minerals would deliver significant synergies and other benefits to BHP which the Board considers are not reflected in the value of BHP’s Indicative Proposal. These include:\n\n• operational synergies in both South Australia (between Olympic Dam, Carrapateena and Prominent Hill) and in Western Australia (between Nickel West and West Musgrave); and\n\n• the significant growth and diversification opportunity OZ Minerals represents for BHP’s global copper portfolio.\n\nThe Board also considered that:\n\n• the Indicative Proposal is highly opportunistic and has come at a time when the LME copper price and OZ Minerals share price have fallen from their recent peaks in March and January respectively;\n\n• OZ Minerals has consistently traded above the proposed offer price for the equivalent of more than 5 of the last 12 months ; and\n\n• the Indicative Proposal price represents a 13.1% premium to the volume weighted average price (‘VWAP’) for the 6 months prior to the Indicative Proposal, a 7.8% premium to the VWAP for the 12 months prior and a 14.4% discount to OZ Minerals’ highest closing price in January 2022 of $29.21.\n\nOZ Minerals shareholders do not need to take any action in relation to the Indicative Proposal.\n\nThe OZ Minerals Board and management team acknowledge the strong ongoing support it has received from its stakeholders to date and will continue to work with them on building a best-in-class global copper business with the objective of maximising long term shareholder value.\n\nOZ Minerals has appointed Macquarie Capital and Greenhill & Co as financial advisers and Gilbert + Tobin as legal adviser in relation to the Indicative Proposal.\n\n Page 2 of 3 OZ Minerals ASX Release |\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nThis announcement is authorised for market release by OZ Minerals’ Board.

The consideration represents an attractive premium of:\n\n• 32.1% to OZL’s closing price of A$18.92 per share on 5 August 2022; and\n\n• 41.4% to OZL’s 30-day VWAP of A$17.67 per share up to and including 5 August 2022.\n\nBHP’s Proposal represents a significant premium to the market value of OZL at the time the Proposal was submitted, at a price that was materially above the average broker price targets. The cash offer would deliver immediate value to OZL shareholders and de-risk any value which may (or may not) eventually be reflected in OZL’s share price.\n\nBHP’s Proposal is subject to certain conditions including completion of confirmatory due diligence to the satisfaction of BHP, entry into a scheme implementation agreement and a unanimous recommendation from the OZL Board that OZL shareholders vote in favour of the Proposal in the absence of a superior proposal.\n\nBHP CEO Mike Henry said:\n\n“Our proposal represents compelling value and certainty for OZ Minerals shareholders in the face of a deteriorating external environment and increased OZL operational and growth related funding challenges.\n\n“We are disappointed that the Board of OZL has indicated that it is not willing to entertain our compelling offer or provide us with access to due diligence in relation to our proposal.”\n\n1 The cash consideration will be reduced by the value of any dividends or return of capital paid by OZL before the date of the implementation of the Proposal, other than the first A$0.08 per share of interim dividend for the 6 months ended 30 June 2022 which (if declared) OZL shareholders will be entitled to be paid without any adjustment to the cash offer price.\n\n For personal use only\n\n\n\nAuthorised for lodgement by: Stefanie Wilkinson\n\nGroup Company Secretary\n\nMedia Relations\n\nEmail: media.relations@bhp.com\n\nAustralia and Asia\n\nGabrielle Notley\n\nTel: +61 3 9609 3830 Mobile: +61 411 071 715\n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\n\nNeil Burrows\n\nTel: +44 20 7802 7484 Mobile: +44 7786 661 683\n\nAmericas\n\nRenata Fernandaz Mobile: +56 9 8229 5357\n\nInvestor Relations\n\nEmail: investor.relations@bhp.com\n\nAustralia and Asia\n\nDinesh Bishop\n\nMobile: +61 407 033 909\n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\n\nJames Bell\n\nTel: +44 2078 027 144 Mobile: +44 7961 636 432\n\nAmericas\n\nSabrina Goulart\n\nMobile: +1 832 781 6698\n\n  BHP Group Limited ABN 49 004 028 077\n\nLEI WZE1WSENV6JSZFK0JC28\n\nRegistered in Australia\n\nRegistered Office: Level 18, 171 Collins Street Melbourne Victoria 3000 Australia\n\nTel +61 1300 55 4757 Fax +61 3 9609 3015\n\nBHP Group is headquartered in Australia Follow us on social media\n\n 2\n\nFor personal use only\n\n\n\nDisclaimer and important notice\n\nForward-looking statements\n\nThis announcement may contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the Proposal and related transactions, such as the expected timing and benefits.
